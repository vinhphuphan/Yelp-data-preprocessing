1,"My husband and I went tonight to teakwoods for the first time. We had a groupon. The place was packed.  Different football games going on tvs all over the place. I didn't mind, but my hubby was in heaven:)   Hostess told us every table was full except outside. So went outside, turned right around because I forgot about smokers, lol. 
   We waited about 1 min and the hostess asked us if we would mind sharing a table with another couple. We said sure.  There was 6 chairs  and 4 of us total so 2 empties inbetween us. It was same as if we had our own table. Worked out great:)

 We started off with the jess Jess boneless wings- Delish!!!!! Not wet like other wings in fact I think they coat them and then throw them on the grill. We Loved them!
I ordered a southern thang burger - my  hubby got a Teaks touch Ã©m all. They were huge!  We each ended up taking half home.  Not just huge but tasty. I loved mine.    We decided to pay and use the groupon another time to ensure we would remember to come back:)

Great place- waitress nice and friendly, good food- we will eat there again!"
1,"So I started this review over a month ago, and I still can't get the Duck Breast Tacos out of my mind.

I don't remember much else at this point, except I got the Lazy Enchiladas and they were great too. But M got the aforementioned tacos, and their tender smoky goodness haunts me.

I need to go back as soon as M gets home."
0,"So-so Mexican food.  I have heard people raving about this place and I don't really get it.  Don't get me wrong, it's better than Manuel's or Filiberto's... but that's about all I can say.

Okay, their Pollo Fundido is good (but not great like you will get at Ajo Al's). But let's talk about the purple and teal accent colors that scream ""I was remodeled in the 80's""! Lame.

Good chips and salsa but small-ass bowls! 

Oh, and don't expect to park in their little lot during dinner rush.  Also, the surrounding neighborhood is definatly the ghetto-side of the Moon Valley area."
1,"Amazing cheesesteak.

One mile from my home is Corleone's. About 15-20 minutes from my home is Capriotti's. I never go to Corleone's. I go to Capriotti's all the time.

The workers here are nice and the cheesesteak is terrific. The large is 20"" I believe, so if you're ordering for yourself and in no mood to eat until you have a stroke, get the medium. Also, try it with the hot peppers. It adds the slightest bit of spice without becoming too overwhelming.

That's really all I can say about this place. Wonderful cheesesteak. I haven't tried anything else because the cheesesteak is too good to pass up when I make the drive down there. The patrons rave about the other sandwiches, though, so I absolutely would not be afraid to try something else. There's maybe 5 or 6 tables inside and 2 outside? so be prepared to order to go if you arrive at prime dine-in lunch/dinner hours.

Do yourself a favor and go to Capriotti's. Help this place attain the reviews and ratings it deserves. The fact that there's only 8 reviews is criminal. I understand it is in the heart of the suburbs, but it's worth the drive."
0,Ordered spanikopita and Greek salad. Spanny was doughy and Greek salad lacked a kick. Unlike any Greek I'd had before. Not going back.
1,"I was extremely happy that we chose Cool Cuts 4 Kids for my son's first big boy hair cut. He was instantly comfortable and drawn in by all of the friendly things they have for children. He was given the choice of a movie or playing a video game, of course knowing exactly what he wants went straight for the video game (Sonic on XBOX). It was pretty much a breeze from that point the little guy was hypnotized and didn't even realize what was going on w/ his beautiful, lovely long hair =( obviously they need to focus on distracting the mom's lol! Jessie who cut my sons long hair was a doll, she didn't seem to be bothered by the mother breathing down her neck as she hacked off my little's hair or the boyfriend taking a copious amount of pictures and video of the whole event. In the end my son looked great and I was a happy mama, I couldn't have asked for a better experience."
1,"What can I say about this place? I love it. Its straight up the road from my place. You can find everything here, not just Asian food. When I get a hankering for Bombay spice, off to Lee Lee I go. I love LOVE their meat counter. I get chills deciding which pork hocks I want. The fish fry service is nice. They have stuff I can't live without and can't find anywhere else i.e. aloe vera juice and those sinfully delicious dessert rice and of course, the makoks. The cashiers can be a lil raunchy though just smile and nod. And a little known secret? The vegetables are freshest on Fridays."
1,Super cool coffee bar with a great outdoor patio for little ones to run around!
0,"Manager got a little whiney when I insisted that he check his shelf before I drive out to pick up a rare item.  Their stock has been in error before, and sure enough... it was wrong this time.  But no apology of course, and no acknowledgment that I was right to have him check his stock.  

Otherwise, selection is good on the whole, but customer service can be a little ""iffy"" at times.  Easy access right off Lake Pleasant Pkwy on SW corner."
0,"What is the big deal about this place?!

It's not great, but pretty good. Not bad, but ok. Just is what it is. We had some wings and a stuffed pizza, and the wings were undersized yet pretty flavorful. The pizza, I just don't understand the hype. Maybe I've had Giordano's, Gino's, and Lou Malnati's too much in Chicago but this place just wasn't it. The pizza is okay, and just okay... if nothing else, WAY too salty. After a while, I felt like I was consuming a salt lick.

Service was weird, and I'm pretty sure our server was on coke. the restaurant was PACKED and the place was buzzing and he came and sat at our table and started shooting the shit. It was very bizzare. We got someone elses order of wings, and didn't know they weren't ours until the server told us (after we had eaten them all) so we felt kind of bad. 

I'd go back here again but I wouldn't really be too eager to."
1,"I like Blu Burger.  If you're a burger lover and like to have it ""your way,"" this is a great choice for you.  There's a lot of competition in the ""gourmet burger"" market these days.  Delux is the Phoenix original and I'm a big fan.  Stax (in Old Town) is also very good.  I mention these others because, while I like Blu Burger, I wouldn't drive from Old Town all the way up to N. Scottsdale for it....I'd just go to Stax.  And, vice versa.  Blu Burger holds its own and does a great job, but not enough that I'm going to drive all the way across town for their ""take"" on a custom hamburger.

If you've got a group, Blu Burger is good choice for variety.  They have veggie, turkey, and salmon burgers, in addition to salads and sandwiches (egg salad, anyone?).  So, unless your friends are incredibly finicky, there should be something to please everyone.  I also applaud the fact that onion rings and sweet potato fries are available as sides.

All in all, Blu Burgers is 4-stars all the way.  Yummy food.  Friendly service.  They do the gourmet burger thing well and you'll walk away full and happy."
1,"We were in Phoenix this past weekend for a wedding and wanted a low key, fun, yummy mexican feast before heading for a night out on the town.

Los Sombreros was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel and it was great!  We sat on the adorable, sparkly light-lit patio and stayed warm with the help of two heaters.  The place was pretty busy but not too loud.  The margaritas were huge and strong as can be and made just the way we liked em!  We shared an order of guacamole - i was slightly disappointed since other yelpers RAVED about it - i thought it was pretty standard, a little better than ""just OK"".  Both of us ordrerd the chilaquiles (he shrimp, me chicken) and they were fantastic although it would have been great  if our server told us that each dish was a legit 10 lbs! We EASILY could have split!

we had such a fun time, the service was good, food was good and the patio was a great backdrop for a casual, albeit fairly romantic meal."
0,"I am going to give Aunty Chiladas 3 stars only because I have gone there since I was like 10.  This place has been a staple in the valley before the 51 went by etc etc.  It definitely looks like it has been there for a while and needs a good  asthetic cleaning.  Our table and chairs were sticky and it was pretty dirty outside on the patio.  There were chairs and miscellaneous items on the outside of the restaurant and it needs some TLC.

Chips (flour) are good but salsa has black olives (yuk, personal preference) and the hot stuff tasted like it had vinegar in it.  It has a great patio for daytime drinking.  Overall the food is above average.

I ordered the fish tacos and they were good.  My accomplice ordered a combo with your typical rice, beans, enchilada, taco etc.  The food was hot and good.  It didn't have a wow factor but the price was good and worth the money.

Holy smokes.......The service was awful.  I am not going to mention any names but it was slow in terms of business and even slower in terms of service.  I hope that they do not correlate but they usually do.  C'mon Aunty you are better than this!!!!!!  

If you live in the neighborhood then it is worth going here.  I probably will not make the drive again.  Good luck Aunt Chiladas."
1,"This restaurant is truely cultural experience in your mouth---Chinese, Mexican with a dash of Jamaican. Pollo Diablo is fab! Mom and Pop place with some true TLC that goes into the food. The beer and wine was a good selection as well! 

Way to Go!"
1,I have eaten here twice now and this place is phenomenal!  Great price and amazing food.  I highly recommend the baked ziti!  I will go back at least twice a month.
1,"I love this place. What can I say? 

Richard Cho not only has some of the best customer service skills I have ever seen (that guy has an amazing memory for names) but some of the most creative approaches to making Sushi in the valley. I love coming to Sushi Eye, I have never had a bad experience in all the years I have been going to the 2x New times Best of Phoenix award winner.

The use of Macadamia nuts is brilliant and an amazing addition to many of the creative rolls that are available. The Spicy scallop roll is a go to for sure. They have (and I know this sounds stupid) the BEST California rolls in Arizona. As pedestrian as that roll is, The California roll is transformed in to a very dessert style treat when ordered at Sushi Eye. Seriously, do it.

Go check it out, introduce yourself to Richard and be amazed when he remembers your name. You will be amazed by the food as well."
0,"After bad experience, I will never return.  It is terrible since they didn't meet my expectation and the price is outrageous.  The most difficult part of the Pho is the broth (req 16 hours of preparation) and it tasted like water.  I had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but can't even eat it.  The restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what I meant with Asian restaurant.  If your fellow Asians don't patronize the place, it is  because your food did not meet our expectation.  Try across the street to the Rice plate Kim Thanh for their rice dish.  It is night and day."
1,"Very very good lunch spot!  Was a little disappointed when I found out they didn't have pizza on their lunch menu. But when I tasted the prosciutto ""sandwich"", I didn't mind anymore. It was a great meal with a relaxing & great ambiance!"
0,"The selection at this store is fantastic!  But I've come to expect the worst from the sales staff, the only hello you get are from the girls standing at the counter when you walk in and even that seems forced.  When I actually need help I feel as though I don't want to disrupt the employees in the middle of their very intense conversations.  I've learned to do my own  research on what ever it is I'm looking for before I go into this particular store."
1,"I have been going here for years.  The staff is always very pleasant, the place is nice and clean and they offer a variety of services.  I also like the $5 kids haircuts on certain days.  Overall, a top notch establishment."
1,"It's usually a ghost town at the downtown Phoenix bars, but when a game and/or concert is happening, suddenly the bars are bustling. Such was the case last night at Majerle's, former Phoenix Suns player Dan Marjerle's sports bar. With the Beyonce concert across the street at the arena AND a D-backs game at the ball park, Phoenix was a hoppin'.

My friend and I stopped into Majerle's, which I've been to a few times before, for dinner and drinks before going to see Beyonce. I had a cheeseburger and Cesar Salad. While I realize it's hard to mess up a Cesar Salad, my salad was seriously the best Cesar I've ever had. And my burger was packed with flavor. No wonder AOL  named them Best Burgers two years in a row. We also had a wonderful chocolate martini (with Vanilla Vodka, not creme based) here. And on Fridays if you're in the mood to really start the night, the bar offers a Corona or Pacifico with a shot of tequila for $7 as part of their Sizzlin' Friday special.

My only complaint was that our waitress suddenly went M.I.A for about 15 minutes when we were trying to close our tab so we could go to the show.  But I'm still going to cut them some slack because this is one of a few fun places to drink in the downtown area.

HOT TIP: A second Majerle's will be opening in Chandler in the fall."
0,"Most livable city my eye!
Plastic yuppies around every corner looking for a reason to belong.  I can't wait for the homosexuals to take control of this dog park and give it some class.

Avoid at all cost."
1,"I eat lunch here sometimes.  The chips are always a little on the burned side and need tons of salt.  I've learned from experience that this just goes better with the salsa there.  Besides, these chips are real.  Not some gigantic bag of factory chips laying on some heating tray in the back.  They killed those tortillas this morning, in boiling oil.  Seriously, the first bite not capture your imagination but you'll slowly find yourself wondering why you can't stop eating them.

They have daily specials, my favorite of which is the chicken mole which is Thursdays I believe.  I'm also a sucker for Friday's chille relleno.  If I'm there on some other less glorious day, I'll opt for the cheese enchilada plate or the Clare burro.  Try the ice tea.  It's got cinnamon in it and it doesn't taste a thing like Lipton's."
1,"We just sold the car we bought at Carmax that spawned the original review here almost three years ago.

As with the purchase, the sale was ridiculously simple. The appraisal took about 20 minutes, and came in ABOVE Kelley Blue Book ""excellent condition"" trade in value -- and the car was in good - very good condition, but certainly not excellent.

A fair price, and no hassle. At a car dealership. Who'd have thunk it?"
1,"Never had a bad meal. Just this week had the halibut ceviche special and as always the best guacamole (especially if you like garlic). The green chile stew was good, although I would have liked a bit more kick. Dined in the patio for the first time and it was great atmosphere. However it was a bit humid. Still a great experience."
1,"Lam's Seafood Market is a rare Asian gem in the Westside.. sort of like me ;-) haha just kidding. 

I love this place! Great prices, fresh seafood :-)
They also have a wide assortment of Filipino products which is a MUST for my kitchen. 

The parking lot is a lil shady and could use some covering for the potholes."
1,"Awesome, awesome, awesome....everything was fantastic. The innovative drink menu, the pizza was out of this world and the bartender was very personable. A++ I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Ban't wait to return!"
0,"Bad service, great food, awful coffee."
1,"Last night I made it in to Beckett's Table after hearing so much about it and everyone was spot on.  The space is terrifically laid out very open and well decorated.  We were greeted by the hostess and shown to our table.  Our server came over right away with fresh water and menu's.  So far so good.  

Laura ordered the Salmon which was excellent I am very picky with my fish being from Seattle and I would've ate that whole dish.  The Cous Cous was great and a nice salad on the side to tie it all together.  

I ordered the Pork Osso Buco Confit which my server said was his favorite.  I see why because this pork was fork tender and just falling apart.  I really enjoyed the dish and the roasted veggies were great.  I didn't even know what half of them were and I was still enjoying them all.  

I wish I had room for dessert because they had one I really wanted to try so I will be back for the Chocolate dipped bacon s'mores.  

Overall a great dinning experience and it's close to home so that's even better."
1,I stayed at the Montelucia for a long weekend and went to Joya Spa for a massage and for the nightly blow out special.  I wish I would have taken advantage of the spa each day since we were staying at the resort.  It is a beautiful spa.  Although it is pricey compared to other spas I've been to they pay attention to every detail and the staff is great.  My massage was unbelievable.  I should have requested the longer massage.  I also got a deal on the massage through a separate website since they did not offer any discounts on services.  The reason I did not give them 5 stars is because they automatically add a 30% gratuity to your service.   The prices were extremely high to begin with.
0,"What kind of sports bar doesn't serve SLIDERS??? Nachos, quesadillas, and celery/carrots options but NO SLIDERS??? Guess that just goes hand-in-hand with the NO MALIBU RUM option!! At least the bartender asked me if their fake option was okay first. Hello... no!!!! 

Wait service was crap after a spring training game as they did not have nearly enough staff to serve people. Had to wait 15 minutes in a booth before anyone acknowledged us. BUZZ KILL!! 

On the plus side, patio is pretty cool and the pool tables when it's not a busy time!"
1,"Five stars, five
1st  star Culinary excellence,
2nd star Service perfection
3rd star Atmosphere and history
4th star flawless operation 
5th star dessert
-1 star, management need not say more.,  

Old School Style fine dinning.  This restaurant dates way back to the early days of downtown Phoenix."
1,"Best pizza in AZ, hands down."
1,I have liked every sub I've had there with the exception of one. Pretty good odds!
1,"From the moment we walked in the door we were treated like celebrities. I wish I was one after leaving here! The food was some of the best Thai we've ever had, and I live in Chicago and have tasted dishes more than a dozen different authentic Thai restaurants. 

We never were without a glass of water or a full glass of wine. I wish I lived here so I could make this a regular stop during my weekly Thai and Sushi cravings. 

The Tilapia was out of this world - topped off with a delicious medley of mint, onions and lemon leaves. I highly recommend the Spring Rolls - very fresh and tasty! Give this place a try - you won't be disappointed."
1,"Don't dog Old Navy. 

Despite a sub par and semi-annoying marketing campaign, clothes here are aight with me. 

And where else can you get a perfectly good pair of cargos and boardshorts for less than thrity bucks a pop? I'm no fashion snob, but I like to think I can generally distinguish ""awful"" from ""not awful"" in most cases. 

For the ""not awful"" variety, Old Navy is dirt cheap and top notch."
1,"Very excited to try this place out.  I tried the sampler of all 4 beers and really enjoyed them all; however, the watermelon ale was my favorite.  Great service, cool, relaxed atmosphere and delicious beer = a winner!"
1,"Cashew brittle, almond brittle, bacon brittle!  Go now, before it's too late!"
0,"What are you all talking about?! This place is awful. Theres a reason why these sandwiches are $3. I can't believe so many people like this place, (although the place was filled with the Chinese people and they have been known to have different taste buds ) You get a 10 inch piece of bread with a bunch of stringy cheap vegetables. From what they said, there was meat on there too,  however i forgot to bring my microscope to verify if there was any on there. This place is like a middle school cafeteria smack dab in the heart of Tokyo's slums (i don't know any Vietnamese cities). Please, homeless people, save your quarters, you're too good for this place. They have good milkshakes, but if you really are homeless (as you should be if you're going to Lee's) you shouldn't be buying ""rich people"" milk shakes anyways, stick with the dollar menu."
1,"Although I am limiting meat in my diet, I went to the Keg for a date.

I had only been one other time for drinks with a couple of friends and it was nothing worth writing home about really.

I think what I really loved this time was the salad.  Yeah, I know, a steak house and I'm blown away by a salad!!  It was the spinach salad with walnuts and cranberries.  It was soooo good.  

Of course my little girly sized fillet was incredible too.

Oh ... and the date ... yeah it was good too!! ;-P"
0,"Changs has a good menu but this location still needs to work on their service.  Each time I have been unimpressed by the consistency of service.  Also, when refilling water, please do not slosh it everywhere.  I know you are in a hurry, but points for style are awarded for not slopping water on the table, floor, and customers...(aka my guests).  

Gets pretty noisy so I recommend getting there before the dinner crowd for a conversational meal."
0,"Cool place but don't try to arrange a special event. The proprietor was arragont, unflexible and unethical when I held my friend's bachelorette party at The Duce. Be warned!"
0,"Narcisse is truly an interesting place. 

Good food and pretty good service. The staff/servers look good and keep the ""image is everything"" so important here in Scottsdale working for this place even if the looks exceed the quality of the service. The late night crowd is of the ""look at me"" variety and makes it a good people watching establishment if you do not mind the huge egos that go with it. 

The selections of food and drink are impressive. If you can reserve a table to dine and drink with friends do it as the place fills up and leads to a fun night out experience for the above 30 crowd."
1,"This place is where I normally go to get all the different loose teas that I love to drink.

They always have at least two or more samples of their 'tea of the day' which are both hot and cold.

The best part about this place is that you can mix different teas together to create your own special blend.

I also bought a cast iron tea pot set that I absolutely adore."
1,"Video Paradise is great.  For those who aren't financially comfortable enough for the monthly payment to maintain a NetFlix account, or when you don't feel like buying something from Amazon.com, Video Paradise is a wonderful substitute if you want to get something that you know won't be at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video.

The selection is staggering.  I remember the first time I stepped in, I was amazed.  The only movie I really wanted to see and they didn't have was The Helstrom Chronicle, but that's okay.  I'm not going to ding this place because they didn't have it.  ""You didn't have The Helstrom Chronicle?  Lame!""  I mean, come on.  No one else has it.  

This place had it all, from little indie films to gross-out horror films I had long forgotten from my disturbing adolescence (Cannibal Holocaust, Faces of Death, etc.).  They even had the worst movie I'd ever seen in my life:  Hard Rock Zombies.

The dÃ©cor is that of sheer, unbridled love for cinema.  You can easily spend hours and hours browsing through their selection."
1,"The PERFECT Breakfast :)  If only I could have this every day :)

Matt's is all you want a breakfast spot to be...cute, friendly and the most amazing food out there.

I highly recommend the hog and chick.  You just can't go wrong with eggs*, bacon*, home fries* (get the home fries, not the hashbrowns) and their toast* served with Terra Verde Farms preserves.  * = best ever, ever, ever

I could write on and on...you've seen the reviews.  Just make sure to make it there, you won't be sorry, you'll be addicted!"
0,"I will agree with the others that it is a cheap sushi option.  But I wasn't impressed.  The sashimi was precut, tasteless and soggy (like it was just defrosted).  Also, I saw that they had pre-made rolls on the back counter.  Come on, how hard is it to make a fresh roll?

I would have given them 1 star but we did get free miso and salad and I didn't get sick from the fish.  We got what we paid for."
0,"A coyote ugly knock off but a cool place. The ladies were friendly and there was one who could dance her ass off. Dayum!! Seriously though, I was the token black chic  and had a good time. Except for the one lady that seem to attach herself to me. Weird to say the least. Overall a cool place.

Be warned, do not attempt to take any pictures in this place. They will hunt you down and stop you. Especially if the ladies are ""performing"" on the bar. A big no-no!!!"
1,"The customer sevice and ambiance here are always great. The managers have always taken care of any issue we've ever had.

The prime rib is really, really good! So is the Steak Au Poivre!

That said, I have to admit that the rest of the food can be pretty hit and miss. I've never had  awful food here, but several disappointments. The managers and staff are so polite and work so hard to make things right that we keep coming back.

The pricing is a bit high for the inconsistent quality, but well worth the early bird and happy hour pricing."
1,"Great Korean Kalbi and other table top meats.
rest of the dishes wasn't that impressive .
Weekend could be really busy you might need to wait for a while to get your food.
but weekdays pretty slow.
If you like Korean BBQ, this is the best place in chandler ,gilbert area."
0,"Slow, unorganized and filled to the brim with crazy people. I prefer to do everything through the service arizona website but recently got a letter that I needed to get a new license because my picture was going to expire. It makes total sense that my license is valid until I'm 65 but the picture expires after 11 years. Of course, the state charges a nominal fee of $12 to replace it. If the state of AZ was in need of my money I'd gladly just give it to them if it means avoiding this nightmare. Oh, and the camera is set to fat..."
1,I would give them a 5 if the service was better.  The food is always great.  I've tried 6 or 7 different versions of the calzone and the stromboli is awesome.  My boys love the pizza.  The price is great for the portion.  Great family spot and the delivery is on time.
1,"Culinary Dropout is a fantastic place to eat! The interior is very rocker complete with  stage for bands, interesting and yummy food, with an array of beers  and amazing food! If you decide to go (which I don't know why you wouldn't ) try their monkey bread for dessert, it is to die for!"
1,"I now have a sixth Sens for delicious Asian tapas- a genre I never knew existed. I always assumed the best tapas disappeared when Aaron May sauteed Sol Y Sombra's last batch of butter-marinated brussels sprouts! Well, I was proven wrong when I hit up the ultra-cool Sens Asian Tapas & Sake on a Thursday night. 

Guests are greeted by electric blue lights, neon pink lotus blossom light fixtures and fresh beats courtesy of a hipster DJ, which transport the hungry to an intoxicating, fluorescent experiens filled with sauces, sakes, and spicy flavors they probably don't even know about yet. 

I tried three top-notch items:

Wasabi Tofu- Hot, in every Sens of the word. Wasabi and 300-degree tempura crusties have the ability to burn you to your soul if you aren't careful. Don't skip it, just poke it with a chopstick or blow on it first. 

White Peach Juice and Vodka- Just like Japanese candy exchange students brought home in high school, it's one of those miraculous flavors most Americans will never have the opportunity to try. Light and sweet, but not overly so, it's a perfect blend you can sip all.night.long. (I did!)

The best, by far, is the Hot & Sour Soup. It's nothing like the kind you get for .99 at Chinese restaurants as an appetizer. A Bilbo Baggins-ey cauldron arrives with a wooden ladle- among the various veggies and disc-shaped noodles is your choice of meat- I chose clams. I've always heard you can truly tell how talented a chef is by how tasty his soup is, and would have to agree. There's nothing to hide behind, and you're confronted by pure flavor. It was complex, different and mouthwatering.

The whole Sens-ation was so genius, I even got past the embarrassment of Chef Johnny Chu snorting in my face for taking pics of my meal on my iPhone."

1,"Every time going to this Best Buy I've had a good experience. The staff is extremely helpful, but not overbearing (constantly asking and asking to help like other Best Buys). They ask once, then give you your space. When you have a question, they're always nice and prompt to answer. Perfect customer service.

It gets better though. The most recent visit to this location I had bought a camera, and even with good reviews online, and the help of the BestBuy staff, I found out the audio on the camera was terrible. Just a problem with that model camera. We didn't know.

The next day I returned the camera with its plan, and had the easiest transition with customer service too get a different camera. Within 10 minutes I was in and out with a new and better camera, and didn't spend an extra dime. It was perfect, and the new camera is great! 

Just one of the many great experiences at this Best Buy. I would give this 5 stars, but the store itself is super tiny, so selection can be limited (the only drawback)."
1,"First time at YC's, had been to other Mongolian BBQ style places, none as ""upscale"" as this. Most of the Mongo places I've been are in the mall fast food court, or in a small strip mall. This place made us go WOW as to how big it was and all the food you get for about $11 a person for dinner.

To go boxes are 50 cents, super reasonable considering you can really cram a lot of food into your bowl to get cooked. I was actually shocked that they suggested you pack the food into your bowl to get more space! Staff was friendly and even helped us out with mixing the sauces.

This place is super close to our house and we will definitely be back frequently."
1,"Hubs booked this kitschy place for us because, well - the other options in the-middle-of-nowhere-AZ were very slim and besides, who doesn't want to stay in motel called Space Age Lodge? 

And man! So surprised! I thought we'd be staying in a very outdated motel room. I mean let's face it, most motels that claim ""newly remodeled"" usually just put in a new tv. But when we opened the door we found new furniture, a very plush bed, new lighting, flat screen tv and a rather large and new ""mini"" fridge. It was really nice - compared to other Best Western's I've visited. 

The train is right behind the hotel, but to be honest, the A/C was cranking the entire time we were there (Arizona in June) so we could hardly hear it. 

And to top it off - we got free breakfast! Not just a continental one either. We had our pick of any breakfast entree and beverage. Came out to a little over $20 of free food! Basically made the room rate $60. 

Yeah for the UFO place!!!"
1,"Last time I went to Zinburger I was wearing a black dress, and the hostess switched out the white napkin with a black one.... real classy."
1,"I finally tried out Valle Luna on Sunday.  I must say that the food is authentic and one of the better Mexican restaurants in the Valley.  The salsa and chips are homemade and simply tasty.  I had the fish tacos that were fried and came with cabbage and soft shells - delicious.

The waitress that served me was attentive.  I must say that the seating did take a while and I was one of two people in line, hence no five star here.  The portions were decent, the tacos could have had more fish in them.

Overall I am pleased with the restaurant and you will be too."
1,"This is one of the top three Dog Parks in the Valley. Plenty of room, well lit in the evenings, plenty of water. I've seen the attendance shift slightly in the last year with less hipsters and more kooks coming in. Not a problem though because there are always multiple groups to mingle with.
For photos and a complete review of this park go to www.dogparkriot.com."
1,"This is a super cute restaurant with a simple yet delicious menu. They stick to basics which I love. They also have a vintage items that you can admire and purchase. Its a great place if you want a quick, simple, cheap yet delicious meal. Their shakes are amazing as well as their potato salad. YUM! If you are in the area, check it our for sure!"
1,"I love that the food was freshly made and the place had a great ""down home"" feel.  The owners are also very welcoming, made us feel like family.  We ordered the Bean Enchiladas, Chicken Enchiladas & Chicken Gorditas.  All came with Rice & Beans.  We all enjoyed our meals.  Good prices also."
1,"I am new to Jamba, however i am surprised at the AMAZING customer service that this store dishes out. One of the workers there has always noticed me as a regular customer. He has a stellar personality, gave me a 20% off card and sometimes has my order ready by the time i finish paying the cashier. He's always very bright and smiling or laughing with his co-workers, I believe his name is Christian. He suggested a banana oatmeal with peanut butter the other morning and i have to say that it has been the most incredible oatmeal i have ever had!!! (You must try this) At times i visit the store twice a day simply because i cannot get enough Jamba Juice!!"
1,"My vintage shopping in the Phoenix area has been disappointing so far. Goodwill, Salvation Army, and Savers are in their separate boat of cheap stuff that is rarely vintage.  Buffalo Exchange shouldn't even be called vintage, because it is not. 

It is much more of a consignment store. Most of the things are new (or lightly worn) and are cheaper than retail prices but more expensive than Goodwill. The selection really isn't bad. I have found a few things here I am really happy with. 

Example: A sweet pair of orange high heels from Steve Madden I think. (I don't really give a crap about brand names, I buy things because I like em, no matter the name). They were thirty bones (not too cheap) but probably a lot less than they would have been at the mall (I am guessing, 60?).

Its still a fun store despite the vintage confusion. Everyone who works there I think gets all the good clothes first because they are always so freakin' adorable! Super friendly (not the fake kind either, can you believe someone is f*cking the handshake in this metropolis?). 

So get over there. You will find some good stuff. Just don't even bother selling anything unless it is high end brand name or the best vintage find you have ever gotten (and that one is even not a guarantee)."
1,"If you are looking for only raw vegan food, this is your place.  Nothing is cooked, everyhthing is 100% raw.  They offer a variety of creative options from appetizers, wraps, soups, pizza and pasta.  They have freshly squeezed juices, smoothies and a variety of different health shots.  The dessert is yummy as well.  This is a must try!"
1,"This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated."
1,"Delicious. With me, i'm all about frosting.  And Sprinkles delivers! Big, thick layer of frosting on every cupcake. I recently had the Mocha, dark choc cupcake with mocha frosting. Wow... It was so rich i had to take a break of about 5 min before i could finish it. I'm a big fan of the vanilla and banana. You just can't go wrong with cream cheese frosting, right?  OH!  And the best thing of all... You can get a ""shot"" of frosting!  Yep... A 1oz dixie cup piled high with a flavor of your choice for 75cents.  I usually eat my frosting shot in the store while waiting for my cupcake order.   ;-)  It's pricey, but its not an everyday thing... Its a treat and a good one!"
1,"This Place just opened up next to the salon I work in. AMAZING! They hit the ground running, 

It's a deli style, where you order at the counter and they bring you the food. I had the Grayhawk Turkey Club and the turkey was great! No packaged crap here. It was thick sliced and probably rotisserie. For the side I had sweet potato tater tots. DELISH! The have regular fries, sweet fries, tater tots, onion rings, etc. 

Great looking salads, Chicago-style dogs, gourmet burgers and yummy sounding mac and cheese. 

The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the price. It's great for dinner, but a little steep for a work day lunch."
1,"We eat dinner here often, usually with exemplary service and delicious food.  If you get seated in Tanya's section, ask to be moved immediately!  She was nice, but a terrible waitress."
1,"I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries!  Any place serving this yummy delicious ingredient deserves my love.  I think I can survive off this for 30 days....any reality TV show takers...huh..huh?  Well, over food was really excellent.  Gourmet burgers are to die for aren't they!?  Sorry Carl's Jr...your $6 burger -- really?  I had the number 3 here - yeah sounds like a secret Chinese sauce, but better!  My burger was cooked just right - juicy and medium-well.  The service was good and the atmosphere tries to re-enact modern hip fine dining.  Though you probably wouldn't know the difference after a few bottles here :) - enjoy!"
0,"Luci's is a good neighborhood spot to buy your health foods, drop in for a coffee or fresh made baked good, or pick up some beer or frozen meat on the way home.  I agree with Pamela's sentiment about it being a marriage of TJ's and Hi-Health with AJ's prices. 

I've had a couple of bad cups of coffee here, but in the 10-12 times I've been they have always been very nice and have remedied any problem very quickly. If it wasn't on my route, I may not stop here much though. Trader Joe's and Hi-Health are right next door to each other at 20/Camelback and you can save a ton of money if you do it that way!"
0,"I can understand why everyone loves this place-- who wouldn't, right? With so many choices of cool, creamy gelato? Well, unless I am just very unlucky and visited on a bad day, this Gelato Spot has gone steeply downhill. My husband ordered a strawberry-kiwi flavored and I chocolate peanut butter. We both agreed: the gelato tasted grainy, with noticable ice crystals. And worse, the flavorings tasted like they came from a bottle, not fresh. IMO, this has become more of a place to see-and-be-seen -- not savor good gelato!"
0,"I've been here a few times with my mom because she really likes it, but overall I wasn't impressed.  The food was tasty, but the service was atrocious.

It was busy the last time we went, but we stood around inside the door for probably 10 minutes before an employee even noticed us.  There were other parties waiting, too.  You just had to stand around and wait for someone to bother seating you in one of the open booths.

Everyone was satisfied with their meal.  I've had the spinach tacos, which were very tasty, and I appreciate having a veggie option that wasn't a run-of-the-mill bean and cheese or chile relleno.  (I've had their chile relleno and wasn't impressed by it.)  But no one refilled our drinks the whole time or checked on us.  Not even once. 

Maybe this is better when you go at a less busy time, but the food isn't mindblowing enough to make it worth the lousy service on a Friday night."
0,"We went there for dinner in April 2011. The dishes are hit and miss, and all are over priced. My wife ordered pad thai, and it was horrible. Instead of the traditional, flavorful dish with peanut and bean sprout, this dish at Flo's is just a salty, chicken noodle. My wife and I both took a bite, we had to send it back. It was not edible. Too salty. Only chicken and rice noodle. There was no peanut, no bean sprout, no pepper, no egg, no ..... Basically, it was NOT a pad thai at all. 

On the upside, my son ordered a sweet&sour chicken, and it was better than most places. They used fresh pineapples.

Based on food quality, ambience, and dinner prices, I say there are tons of other places that are better."
1,"I LOVE this place..  This is my sushi bar.  Danny, one of the two sushi chef's is awesome.  I have always found their sushi to be very fresh.

About a year ago they came out with a special sushi menu.  With rolls like these: Dirty Harry, Mr. Miagi, Rio, you cannot go wrong.  Especially if you like spicy (like me)!

Even the non-sushi is great.  This is one place my 6 year old loves that doesn't have a drive through window.

Also, $4.50 sake bombs!!!  $4.50!

Go here.  Try it.  Don't be scared off by a couple of so-so (ok, 1 bad) reviews.  I am looking to even have a UYE here in the near future!  Should be getting a call tomorrow to get it scheduled.

Almost forgot!  They have some big screen TV's!  Watch sports here!  They are hugely popular for UFC fights and football..  

Just go.  Now..  Seriously.  Review part is over..  You are wasting time reading the fodder I have written here.  You could be finding your keys..  Putting on socks and shoes..  Hell, skip the socks..  Wear sandals.  Save time."
0,"This is going to be brutal.  Hide the children.

If you've been to Chipotle, you'll feel right at home at Qdoba. That is, until you start eating. Complete and utter ripoff of the concept, except for the part that matters - the execution.  Where Chipotle succeeds, Qdoba fails miserably.  The ingredients are orders of magnitude shittier.  The burritos are just plain bad..  My burrito was loaded with rice and beans and very little meat - basically the opposite of what you'll get at the ""other"" place.  On top of that, the rice and beans were the suck.  And if you know Brak, you know that he LOVES his beans.  But not these.  About all they're good for is a massive bean fart shortly after ingesting this crap.

If you want to know the root cause of this debacle, check out who the parent company is - it's Jack In The CrackÂ®.  Pretty much explains it all.

Avoid at all costs.  Receives Brak's dreaded zero-star review, rounded up to 1 because Yelp doesn't allow a zero."
1,"The best Chinese food I have had since leavong Chinatown in California.  The crab puffs had crab, not Krab and were much more crab than puff.  The food was cooked perfectly and delicious.  I strongly recommend the Mu Shu Pork!!"
0,"If you want a school that cares more about your financial aid money than you, this is the school for you. Education is horrible. If you are a democrat, don't speak your mind; you will be considered a reject from day one. I got 100% on my graduate papers and think I did not contribute anything to the fields. This institution is a joke."
1,The hula burger was awesome! Great service. The hostess is very kind and sweet. What a great find!
1,I love this place.Their italian beef with hot peppers is a must. I have also tried their sausage and pep sandwich which is just as good.Their prices are as good as you can get. So if you're hungry stop in & get full!!
0,The employees here are really nice and I like the island feel. The food is pretty good and I like it because there aren't many other places in town with Hawaiian food. I also like that you can get beer here.
1,"I just have to tell you that this place is amazing. Not only is the food top notch so is the service. It is a rare find to get awesome food, a comfortable environment and excellent service at a reasonable price all rolled into one. The homemade sausage is excellent, the pizza is perfect, the choice of deli meats is extensive and homemade side salads (red potato dill is my favorite) and everything on the menu is fantastic. I have read that people say the wait is long, (which I find unfounded) but when you are considering what you are getting, the wait means nothing. I have waited longer for Sysco reheated food in a restaraunt (bleh) and had worse service. I would take a 10 min longer wait for really good, fresh food any day. If you can't appreciate that then maybe chain restaurants is where you should stay. We really do our best to stay away from those and finding places like Defalco's is really tough. We will continue to be loyal customers and spread the word of one our favorite places to eat. Don't pass the opportunity to try this place!!"
1,"The place was just your typical stable, but my wife and I had a wonderful experience here. It was our first time riding, so the staff took great care to show us how to mount and maneuver the horses. We then followed a guide through an orchard for an hour's ride (just the right length of time for us as beginners). The horses were very tame, and were easy to ride. The best part of the experience, however, was our interaction with the staff. They couldn't have been more friendly and more helpful. We're excited to go back."
1,"What a fantastic experience!  

If there is a high-end food product that you don't find at whole foods, then you may find yourself to be one of the pickiest eaters known to man.  This place offers everything under the sun.  For the love of God they have almost 30 different types of olives!

My family is new to shopping here and we like to splurge a little bit.  For some reason it's comforting to know that there are 4 different kinds of ribeye and what seems to be almost 100 different types of cheeses.  I guess realizing that makes me think that there won't be anything forgotten at Whole Foods.  Unlike Sam's Club, Whole Foods gives samples that actually taste delicious and almost make you grab for seconds when instead you just grab an actual wrapped portion of the product (darn, had to buy some sometime).

On a 'grocery store' level, this Whole Foods gets 5 stars that's for sure.  The only reason it gets knocked a star is because some Whole Foods locations offer more services to make their guests feel like it is supposed to be much more than your typical grocery store.  This is a location where I think the patrons would be willing to use everything that they had to offer if given the choice."
1,"I visited Smeeks this weekend as part of Carmelpalooza. Amazing! It's a fun little store with darling treats and trinkets to drop your cash upon. 
Bacon belt? Yep.
Women's mustaches? Of course!
Butterscotch Peanut butter cups? Yes!
Very fun. A bit pricey, but I couldn't resist buying some monster finger puppet key toppers.
Yay Yay Yay!"
1,"I can dig!  Food here is very good.  I believe everything here is made from scratch the soup to the sauce cause they taste wonderful.  I go for lunch every now and then and I've seen this place slowly pickup business.  It has that deli-sport restaurant feel, but the food brings it home.  I appreciate the usage of real plates instead of paper or styrofoam plates -- very environmental friendly!  I would definitely recommend this place for lunch - 1/2 sand, their pastafagioli soup = Yum! & drink."
0,"For frozen yogurt quality, I give this place a one. Honestly, it's small, there's very little variety in terms of toppings, and the yogurt tastes cheap... Probably because it's a big franchise. There is a reason why you're paying less for an ounce... Truly - you get what you pay for. 
The concept is neat, sure, but if you're looking for pizzazz then you should try Yogurtini... It's just up the road from Yogurtland. Anyway, the single star says it all... ""Eek! Methinks not."""
0,"I was here once. A reasonably sized girl broke her white plastic lawn chair and tumbled to the ground. I averted my gaze and tried to focus on my overpriced mediocre eggs benedict. My friend just laughed and laughed. I guess I should have ordered the mimosas, too."
0,"The last three times I have been here, the hostesses have been so incredibly rude I have to update and ding them a star. The last time was the last straw and we just left turned around and left.
Yes, you work at a popular property. That does not entitle you to be rude and nasty. It's weird as it seems to limited just to the front of the house. The waitstaff is usually great, food is great, and cocktails are top notch.
Whoever is running this place, its time for a sit down with your girls in the front."
0,"My gang usually stumble in her at some point during our nights out and about in Old Town.  They have a decent selection of beers on tap and there are usually a couple tables open if you want to sit down. It's a bar, not a club, so don't expect much.  They have servers that are polite and prompt and the wait at the bar isn't usually very long.  
Worth a stop to support a local biz."
1,Really delicious breakfast burritos! They are true Mexican-style! I get the ham and egg breakfast burrito and it comes with cheese and a fresh tortilla. They are inexpensive and really big! I'm so glad I work a mile from this place! I go at least once a week!
1,"I'm a horrible haircut customer. I never remember how I get my haircut and squared or rounded, I just don't keep track. I've been to all of the chains and was thinking that maybe I should finally find just one person to cut my hair for now on until I got a coupon. I really enjoyed my visit, I didn't get the MVP thing cause I wasn't expecting it and I didn't have time for it. They are all pretty knowledgeable and quick. Only once was I not fully happy with the cut, but it's hair it grows back. They are a bit more pricey but I always go with a coupon, I get them every month. I'm not the most talkative person so it gets kinda awkward when you sit there in silence so I love that you can just sit there and watch sportscenter."
0,"VERY BAD SERVICE + BELOW AVERAGE SUSHI = 2 STARS.

The 2 stars is because the quality of food is below average and not that great. The Salmon looks like its been on the plates forever and has a real slimy look. I've had way better sushi in some all you can eat places!! Basically the only good thing is the gimmick with the conveyor belt. I would advise the reader to save his/her money for a better sushi place like Kabuki.

The next bad thing about this place is the atrocious service. They never bring you the drinks or seat you in a timely manner. God knows what the waitresses do over there...they run around as if its their first day at work and never get anything done like clear tables, get checks etc. I've been here a couple of times and I saw that the 2nd time, the patrons were not even waiting for the waitresses...they formed a line at the cashier like Denny's."
0,Honey Bear's is no Joe's BBQ in Gilbert but I actually enjoy it. I usually get the pork sandwich and potato salad and I find myself going here. I like the BBQ sauce and the quality of the meat is good. If I'm in Tempe and want BBQ I usually go here.
0,"Tried to eat here Friday night for the seafood buffet. We waited in line for 90 minutes before finally giving up. Would have been much sooner but the drive down there from my house is almost an hour. 

They have three lines, tiered based on the level of player's club card. The diamond card holders waltzed right in and the hostesses would seat from that line until it was empty before anyone from the 'lesser' lines would be seated. At the end, we stood still... didn't move an inch... for 20 minutes. So no-one from our line was seated for 20 minutes while dozens of people waltzed right through in the diamond and platinum lines. 

What a fucking joke. Waster my whole evening trekking down there dreaming of crab legs just to be snubbed by them.

Never, EVER again."
0,"The service was great! We had a large group & had called prior to make a reservation. Our table was ready when we arrived & they had assigned 2 servers. They were both incredibly pleasant & attentive. Our food came out really quickly & no one had any complaints. I wouldn't say this was authentic Mexican food, but it doesn't have to be. A good time was had by all :)"
1,"Went to the Living Room over the weekend with some girlfriends.  Having never been there before I didn't know what to expect.  The place is super adorable, great decor.  The bar set-up is very weird though.  It's like, half bar then turns into half table.  I had to wait for my friends to show up and we were on the list, and I had a hard time finding a decent place to just stand.  The place was packed, and it was 8pm on a Saturday night, with a torrential downpour going on outside.  I thought it would be quiet wtih the craptastic weather, but it definitely was busy. 

It's loud.  Not only from people talking/yelling but the music.  I was screaming at my friends at our table.  For being a wine bar, I thought the wine menu was on the small side.  A good selection, but I thought I'd see more. 

The crowd is definitely distinct.  You have to really like it to tolerate the place.  For me, I really liked it.  It's livly, lots of young 30-somethings (although we ran into our old, formerly hot, teachers from high school which was weird), lots of good looking people, yet it didn't feel pretentious to me at all.  I just moved here from a big city and I felt like I was back home.  Which is a good thing.

Food was average.  I'd try something else next time I go back.  This time I had the chicken pesto sandwich with a side salad.  The sandwich was very good but the dressing that came with my salad was SUPER SALTY!! Gross!  I just passed on it and ate the rest. 

I also like the fact that they do board games here.  And the patio is probably amazing when the weather cooperates."
0,"I thought it was ok, hubby thought it was spectacular.  I tried to order my standard soy vanilla latte but they were out of vanilla - to me that's like a hamburger joint being out of ketchup.  So I got a mocha instead - nice coffee flavor, but the chocolate didn't taste so special.  Hubby had a cappuccino and would definitely get it again."
0,"Your typical Tempe boozatorium.

It has a generic and unmemorable name likely because the name describes everything about this place.

If you wander into it, you won't remember much more than that."
1,"Blue 32 wins my MVP award. I practically lived at this place during the Giants World Series run, and loved every moment of it! 

Despite the fact that I am still stuck in an orange and black-out World Series Championship daze (that will probably continue for at least another month or so), I must up the rating of this place to 5 stars because Blue 32 is now my favorite sports bar in all of Scottsdale. The service is top notch and the atmosphere is excellent for game watching.

Here are the main two reasons why I will keep coming back here: 1. Food - This is the best bar food ever! You must try their onion rings, they are crazy delicious. Also if you aren't in the mood for fried food they have tons of healthy options as well. 2. TVs - Sports fans, it doesn't get much better than this when it comes to TVs. Outstanding visibility from every angle of the restaurant. No sports bar in Scottsdale can compete with Blue 32's TVs.

Go here for a game and you won't be disappointed. I decked myself out in orange and black, screamed, jumped around with excitement and just all around enjoyed myself while hanging out in the bar area during the games. Overall, Blue 32 is a high quality sports bar and you've got to check this place out!

P.S. GO GIANTS! =)"
1,"If you are a beer snob, stay at home trying to make it yourself.  If you enjoy a decent local beer in an old chandler building with a nice atmosphere give this place a shot.  The owner used to be a brew-master at Four Peaks Brewery which is a local favorite in Tempe.  

I am not a fan of the over-the-top Hops that a lot of folks enjoy.  A few of the offerings here have a bit too much bite for me.  The red ale was my favorite until they changed the recipe and over did the bitterness.  Right now I get a Sun Devil Ale when I go in and it is pretty good.  They will bring you a taster if you ask and will explain the offerings to help you choose.    

The food is always good.  It is a bar so don't expect 5 star cuisine.  The fries are great and the sandwiches and salads are good as well.  I haven't been disappointed with a meal yet.  Even when busy service is decent.  Enjoy the beer, watch the game and let it all unfold."
1,"Another 5 star review. I saw Beauty and the Beast with my little niece last night and she couldn't stop talking about it. 
(It was her reward for having good grades) 
I know I'm supposed to be the reviewing the theater, but I can't bring myself to rate them lower than 5. It was such a good show that even though there were a few minor issues at the theater,  they still deserve 5 stars. The auditorium is starting to show its age and hopefully they get the funding to make improvements. (Also some lady with a big head sat in front of us and my little niece couldn't see, so I changed seats with her.)  No big deal. 
Other than that the staff were very professional and helpful as always. 
Thank you again to yelp, Lindsey and to Gammage for giving us complimentary tickets. My little niece and I appreciates it and we enjoyed the show. :)"
1,"My wife and I absolutely love this place.  Yes, it's a bit pricier... but yu get what you pay for: excellent food and service!  The patio is even cigar-friendly, which is a huge plus for us!  We visit often!"
1,"You know, for a goodwill this one really isn't bad!  They have a ton of clothes that are actually displayed to make them look orderly and clean instead of the usual crammed heaps and stacks you see.  I love the books - a great selection of books you have always meant to read (and I don't mean the old classics, though they have those too) like James Patterson, Anne Rice, and all those gooey Twilight books.  Looks like they moved out most of the furniture recently, but perhaps they will be getting a new shipment soon.  Lots of knick-knacks and vases, and about 25 printers to choose from!  Check here first if you are looking for one of the above stated items - they is a good chance you will find it!"
1,"True fine dining has come to the Valley.

If you are looking to have a special dinner, this is the place.  And plan on spending 3 hours as it is a true culinary experience.

The tasting menu consists of options of 4, 5, or 6 courses, and they can be paired with wine, if you like.  This is the way to go and even for tasting portions, they are not micro-mini.

The choices for each course are extensive.  At least 6-10 each.  AND, the coolest part, is that you won't find any ingredient repeated twice.  NONE.  Yes you might find tomatoes in the same night, but they won't be the same type.  That's not easy to pull off, considering the variety of the menu.

But, while you are between courses, Chef Binkley will send out numerous amuse bouche - which, if you don't know, are tiny little one bit or one gulp appetizers like, mini sliders the size of a half dollar, or pancetta mousse in a shot glass.

We ate there for my ex-H's bday, and had 8 amuse bouche.  Also, if you let them know in advance you are there for a special occasion, you will get custom printed menus for everyone at the table mentioning the special event.

The ONLY drawback, is the atmosphere.  It definitely doesn't fit the quality and beauty of the food.  But, I still give it a 5, as the food is superb.

If you are a true foodie GO. I was excited the whole meal, as I couldn't wait to see what came out next!   If you are a meat and potatoes type with an uneducated palate, save your time and money, since you won't appreciate the menu at all."
1,i love the $5 happy hours. all the dishes are a great value and delicious!
1,"Tried this restaurant with a groupon. Probably would not have, if I didn't have the coupon. Don't let the storefront and decor stop you from going in. The restaurant is super clean and the wait staff is very friendly. And the food, WOW!  We split the Shrimp Ceviche and the combination pupusa plate. The portions were very generous. I ordered the fruit drink. Everything was absolutely delicious. One of my new favorite restaurants . Will definitely be back."
1,"I love Zoya! She does a phenomenal pedicure and eyebrow wax. I never have to wait. It is very professional there. The decor is beautiful and I always relax when I'm there. Zoya told me today that she does Swedish massages at their sister salon which is right across the way in the same parking lot. They have a hair salon in the other location as well. 

I have been going there for a while for the Happy Feet pedicure. Best exfoliation, great neck massage and paraffin wax for the feet. 

Ahhhhh...my feet are so happy right now!"
1,"Tried this place through Groupon.

Don't have a palette or interest in wine types, so I can't talk about the wine quality. I had all their sweet wines and liked them.

The cheese plate had four of them, I wouldn't say they were uniquely different from one another. There was sage derby, brie, mahon and something else. One of the crackers that came with the plate was very hearty and nice, the other was horrible - like oily tortilla chips that weren't fully fried. The plate also came with cranberries, apricots, grapes, olives and salted nuts and seemed like a good value. 

Overall though I had a good time, and thought the combination of wines and cheeses I had was good. The decor was typical AZ type, brown and beige. They had live music. We sat at the tasting bar but there were groups at tables too. Outdoor seating was available too. Saturday evening was full but not overcrowded.

The person who attended on us was very nice - Christine I believe her name was. Another guy who talked to us first thing when we sat down asked and classified us as Groupon or non-Groupon, which felt weird but I guess that reflects how many Groupon customers they had had. He also said ""you are not drinking to make me happy, you're drinking to make you happy"" when we asked him if he had recommendations which I thought was weird at best."
0,"Having lived in Mesa and delivered sub sandwiches to some of the tweekiest of tweakers, I don't feel any shame in admitting that whole area now resides in a dead zone for me. When I get that itch to go out and tear up the town, waste away a lazy afternoon, or enjoy a nice dinner, I think of places north, south and west of Tempe. It's like my brain has one of those little electric dog collar things attached to it, and when I start to stray too far east, it gives me a subliminal zap so I erase Mesa from the map in my mind.

So naturally, Stray Cats is usually a place I visit when meeting up with others who have suggested it. 

Thing is, I always end up having a pretty good time when I go there. The drinks are priced reasonably and generally on the strong side, the bartenders are friendly and quick to serve. The music is pretty good, but I've never been here when a DJ's spinning. I used to like the fact that there was an air conditioned smoking room off to the side with plush couches and big televisions. The crowd is always diverse, friendly and easy to engage in slurred conversation.

It just doesn't have any special oomph for me. I'd much rather frequent Hollywood Alley a couple miles south, where there's pool and live music. Unfortunately it's also on the black list of Mesa, so maybe I should find a way to reverse that programming. It's not just tweakers and mormans, it's not just tweakers and mormons, it's not just tweakers and mormons...."
1,"In response to a recent thread about Boba drinks in CenPho, I said that Rainbow served at least 1 flavor- chai- which my husband found to be ""just ok."" When Hubby asked me this morning if I wanted to ""taste the Rainbow"" for breakfast, I asked him to check on the Boba situation. It turns out that Rainbow listened, and they now will add Boba to any of their drinks. The woman behind the counter said you can call ahead so you don't have to wait. Hubby's vanilla and my strawberry frap that he brought home today were still ""just ok."" The donuts are still really good, and they finally have some stable hours, 4 am to 8 pm."
1,"This place is our go to mexican place. I love the hot sauce and you can't go wrong with the Fundido sauce on the burritos. I personally enjoy the Chicken Fajito Chimi with Fundido sauce. It could possibly be the worst thing there to eat (and I love it). For the healthier days, I like the Pollo Salad. The chicken is always great here."
1,"This place is pretty incredible.  The california club and the breakfast buzz are probably the best items on the menu IMO... but seriously, you can't go wrong.  The only thing I've had that I didn't really care for is the Breakfast Burrito, but that was because it was just a little boring compared to the other choices on their menu.  It's a long wait in the drive thru 99% of the time, but it is absolutley MORE than worth it."
1,"4.5: The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the location. The view from the patio is pretty much parking lot and the backs of buildings. 

But, holy cow! The wine selection is VERY good. The staff are friendly and helpful and make excellent suggestions (thanks for the zinfandel tip! YUMMM). The prices are fair too!

And, as much as I love green chile, my new fave is the fig and gorgonzola app. Still a pannini... I didn't know blue cheese could get that creamy when it melted!

Man, I wish this place was closer... I'll still be back!"
1,"These guys helped me out with my rear windshield wiper.  They could have just shrugged their shoulders and said they didn't have the part, but they worked with me and tried a couple of different options until we found a solution.  Everyone I encountered was great."
0,The server could have been better. She spilled a coke on my lap. This made me late for my movie. The wait was so-so however the food was cooked to my liking. I will go back.
0,"I want to like this place as it is in the neighborhood and there aren't many other options around here, but this is probably the worst restaurant/bar I've ever had the misfortune of going to. 

My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer, despite the bar being nearly empty, as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.  

I drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.  I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip... I just want out of here.  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well.

On other trips here my wife and I have had the food.  It's not any better than the service sadly.  I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.  Overall just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front.  Nobody's there because it's simply horrible.  Avoid at all cost.  I wouldn't eat here again, but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help.  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house.  Looking at other reviews on here, I see I'm not alone in my feelings about the service.  Get rid of these people already... just sad!!"
0,"I was hoping for a more adult friendly place. I haven't been here in years, it used to be a gay-friendly hotspot. Now it seems to caters more to families and children. I've heard the restaurant is good, but I haven't visited yet."
1,It's not only a book store but also a community wherein a lot of readers meet. They also have a wide selection of used and unused books as well as novelty items so I get to do my shopping at the same time!
0,"Stopped by to see what's new after the summer reopen.  New merchandising is really cool with the mixed textures with the textiles,  Some really great stuff and pretty good prices.  I've been in this store numerous times and though I like to be left alone to wander, when I do make - or try to make a purchase the owner and her staff are borderline rude.  There are many other great places where the staff is welcoming and anxious to help.  I've decided not to include this store on my regular rounds."
1,"If you need a hat, this is where to go."
0,"Oh Man. This is not the place I imagined I would assign my first 2-star rating. I woke up as sad and disappointed as I felt last night, leaving the legendary, old school Durant's after an evening of less than mediocre food and terrible service. Sigh.

Honey had a great lunch there a few months back and was excited to impress me with dinner. We saw Durant's listed on Restaurant week and were excited for the excuse to squeeze into one of their comfy booths amidst the bow-tie clad staff and velvet wallpaper. The instant time travel type setting usually makes for an incredible dining experience. Shall I fault the poor rating to their efforts at succumbing to a prix-fixe menu? Perhaps.

Our time at the bar proved to be the best part of the night. Watching the bartender mix the martini's the way my Pops used to was nostalgia at its best. I LOVED that they serve bottles of beer with a toothpick of meat and cheese. That is brilliant. It could transform me into a beer drinker after all. We met up with friends and continued on to the dinner portion of the evening.

Moving on to the booth, our waitress was definitely in the weeds. Having been in her shoes before, I always try and accommodate the situation. We ordered an appetizer and a few cocktails and waited to order dinner when she seemed able. Appetizer of artichoke dip was yummy. Tortillas and garlic bread and warm, cheesy dip delivered promise.

The limited menu was just that. Okay first course salad/soup options. Main course offered Pot roast, a small steak or chicken fried steak. Stewed steak, grilled steak or fried steak. Really? Your menu is impressive...if you really don't want to participate in Restaurant week, then don't. 

Honey ordered the chicken fried steak as a continuation of the old school vibe. I ordered the trout off the regular menu after C pointed out the fish option. J ordered the cfs too. 

Food took a bit, but we had good conversation flowing, so it wasn't a problem. Salads and soup were fine. Main course arrived and we were all a bit surprised by the size of the fried steak. I guess when you think of this meal from the past, it encompasses half the plate and is oozing with country gravy. This steak was the size of a burger and had a dollop of thick gravy-esque goo on the top. Garlic mashers were appropriately placed. 

My trout was supposed to be topped with a lemon caper sauce but instead it was slathered with a gravy that hinted at lemon and was all wrong for a fish. The trout was pain-fried and should there have been a light sauce, it would have been good. But the fried fish with the gravy was just so not good. 

The fried steak too, so not good. Mashers achieved an appropriate level of goodness, but you really don't want mashed potatoes to lead your dinner. 

We were devastated. 
The whole experience was so not what we came for or expected. I do want to give Durant's another chance and order a big, juicy steak and let them wow me like they do to so many, but it will be a while before our trek downtown includes a walk through their kitchen."
1,"Sunflower market is WAY cheaper than Whole Foods and has a lot more than Sprouts. It's my first choice of healthy grocery stores!

They have the freshest produce around without it being full of bugs like Trader Joes. Their selection is very wide and their employees are really nice. Seriously I can't stand the employees at Whole Foods or Sprouts. They're such pretentious jerks sometimes. 

Whether I need lamb or bison meat, coconut milk ice cream, or almonds...this is always my first choice. They're also the only place in town that has every kind of vegan sliced cheese. Whole and Sprouts have some of them but which flavors are sporadic and random. I will never stray from Sunflower again!"
1,"""6 inch tuna on white bread, with everything including spinach, but NO pickles"".

Not even joking, this THE only subway that ever gets my sandwich right. Thank you for the $5 meal deal, it beats the other chains in this shopping plaza as far as price for lunch."
1,"If you haven't been to this place - go! Seriously. It's amazing. It's the best little hole-in-a-rundown-strip-mall you can find. And it's cheap!

Nestled between stores like Big Lots and some electronic place with Mexican ranchero music blasting, this tiny place is hidden in the corner. The owner is from El Salvador, so don't expect it to be Mexican food -- there are many similarities, but the dishes themselves are different.
Walking in, you can smell the homemade pupusas -- seriously, it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central America. It's amazing. There are only a couple waitresses, and I don't think they speak much English, but the menu is in pictures, as well as in Spanish and some English, so you should do just fine.

Get the pupusas - they're like thick, hand-made tortillas stuffed with either pork, cheese and beans or, my favorite, cheese and loraco flower, which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus, to me. It's definitely the best one. These things come with salsa and some coleslaw (if they don't, just ask for the salsa) and are very filling!
The other dishes are really good, too. For a low price, you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans - and this place doesn't skimp on the fixin's. They put slices of fresh tomatoes, avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates.
I honestly LOVE it here. If you want to avoid the crowds, come at an off-hour... then you can just sit, relax and watch the telenovela on the TV in the corner. For dessert, pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash register.
I can't recommend this place enough!"
1,"A perfect way to top of an exotic shopping experience at 99 Ranch.  The Taiwan Express has photos of many (not all) of their dishes. Very authentic.  

Also try some shaved ice for desert (brought me back to Singapore!).  My kids love the shaved ice, though they are more used to Asian foods than most kids.  

Note that the Buffet section (to the left) is better than any mall food courts, and may be more tame for some taste buds.  

AND - in between the buffet and Taiwan Express you can buy a whole roast duck for about $12.50, which they will cut up for you.  Be sure to buy some Plum Sauce (elsewhere in the store) for a sweet dipping sauce for the duck (yummy!)."
1,Enjoyed date night here with the hubby. Try the gluten free pizza. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Mmmmmmm
1,"Phoenix Muni is a great stadium to see Oakland A's Spring Training Games. Yes, it's older than many of the other Arizona stadiums, but it has a simple charm that serves it wall. Great seats can be found just about anywhere in the park, and for $22 we were in row 7, just to the right of home plate. It's also pretty easy getting in and out of both the stadium and the parking lot.

The only (minor) negative is probably common to most stadiums: there don't seem to be enough vendors (at least beer vendors; several people around us mentioned it), and the concession stands can get somewhat backed up at times. But for a relaxing place to watch baseball in the Arizona sun, it's hard to beat Phoenix Municipal Stadium."
1,"Yes this is a chain but after traveling in Maui for a week and then coming back home to Kahlua Pork from Rumbi, I can honestly say that the Kahlua pork here is better than any of the places I ate it at in Hawaii. Crazy huh? The Kahlua pork at Rumbi is so moist and tender and when its paired with some of their magnificent teriyaki sauce and Rumbi rice (rice cooked with coconut milk and beans), it is out of this world. The Kahlua pork plate at Rumbi has lately been the first meal that comes to mind when I want comfort food. This is a bit of a problem cause that is normally on a work day during lunch and after eating a meal of pork, rice, mac salad, and coleslaw, I am just down right exhausted and in dire need of a nap. 
I used to come here quite frequently but forgot about this place and I am not sure why. Besides the Kahlua pork and Rumbi rice, I can say that their mac salad, sweet potato fries, and their beach burger are really good as well. If you are looking for something different, yet tasty and satisfying, try Rumbi. I think you will enjoy it."
1,"First time here, new favorite. You can create your own antipasti plate, and the pretzels and fondue are AMAZING. Also the ricotta gnocchi is the best I have ever had. Service was good, Liz was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful. Monkey bread is also stellar. I cannot wait to go back."
0,"I was extremely excited to try what is considered some of the ""best pizza"" in America..., finding out it was only minutes away from my new office. My expectations may have been too high. Our party of four went for a late lunch, we did not have to wait for a table. 

My fiance and I decided to try 2 pies, the margherita and the Biancoverde. The Margherita pie came out quite dry, not with the wonderful chewy crust that a great margherita should have... however, the Biancoverde, a white pizza with Ricotta and arugala, was fantastic! Incredible flavors, the extra toppings kept this pie perfectly moist and delicious, it was really quite perfect. 
Unfortunately, we had a hair in one of our pizzas, however, that's only part of the reason for the mediocre rating... 
The hair, the 1-2 star margherita, and the non-existant meat selection I can only give a 3 star rating... (I'm a bit of a carnivore, I need more meat!)
I'm still looking for something to replace the incredible pizzas I've had at my favorite neopolitana joing back home in Canada, Famoso. 

Will I be back to Pizzeria Bianco for another go? Absolutely..."
1,"I never knew this movie theater existed. I mean I don't frequent paradise valley mall that often, and when I go, I have tunnel vision as I go straight to the stores I need to go to and get the heck out of there. So when Travelzoo had their movie special ( two tickets, 1 large popcorn and two large drinks for $15), I couldn't pass it up. The theater is small but very quaint. The seats are EXTREMELY comfortable and they kinda recline. How cool is that. Plus the best part? the staff are super duper friendly. A huge win in my book. I will definitely be going back to this cute little hidden gem of a theater."
1,"NO BETTER BREAKFAST IN AZ. From scrambled eggs to their blueberry pancakes. Top end. Yes, you pay for it. But it's special, like Valentines Day. Just pay out and enjoy the treat. Lunch is also nice, especially if you get a seat outside so you can people watch. Great wraps and sandwiches. Haven't tried anything later here yet. But I saw their happy hour specials and it is on my TO DO list."
1,"Given the dearth of German restaurants in the greater Phx area, this is about as good as it gets.

Had the sausage sampler.  The krakauer wurst was pretty unique.  The bratwurst was good too, but brats usually have a pretty low bar to clear to be good.

Had the Schweizer Schnitzel as a main course.  Very good.

The meal came with a cup of soup of the day, which in this case was mushroom.  Very good.

You can't eat ambiance/decor so I generally don't care about things like that but if the owners have a spare dollar or two they may want to paint the place and replace the drop ceiling.  Neither of those things will keep me away but they may want to look into those things."
1,"this place is growing on me. i wasn't a big fan at the beginning thinking they cater to the yuppy crowd that wants to be seen. i still think that's the case, but i think people truly go for the atmosphere and good food. the vig cobb is really tasty and you just can't go wrong with sweet potato fries...my weakness! the interior is really cool and creative and the vibe is casual and friendly. lunch hour tends to get a little busy, but they have a decent amount of seating for such a small place."
1,"Second visit to L&L.  The first was at lunch with a group of moms second with my family.  The service was excellent which is saying a lot.  They didn't have to ask what we needed they surveyed the table and kept the meal moving.  Which I appreciated since we had the three kids with us.  This is not traditional chinese, so get the asian nachos.  They are a giant appetizer very unique and quite tasty.  EVERYONE enjoyed their meals and the happy hour deals are pretty good.  I see more visits in my future."
0,i don't understand the hype. it's very typical american chinese food. tried the bourbon chicken and it was nothing special - tasted very teriyaki.
1,"Three stellar write-ups pushed me over the edge and I decided that it was time to take my self for a much needed pedi. When I arrived, the place was packed, but thankfully they gladly take walk-ins and I had only a brief wait before I was whisked away to my massaging, bubbling chair of goodness.

I have to echo the other reviewer's comments on cleanliness and down-right bargain for the service provided. Not once did I have that ""eww, you aren't actually going to touch me with that"" reaction. I didn't swoon from toxic vapors as soon as opening the door. And my attendant was super friendly and completely cool with the fact that I had clearly neglected my heals for the last two months (something that was hugely apparent after she started filing away - how mortifying... skin flying everywhere!!!)

And for those of you that might fear the Elaine experience (Seinfeld reference), fret not. You can actually understand everyone one that works here and shouldn't find yourself sitting and wondering ""what in the hell are they saying about me now?""

Take your twenty-bucks (plus a little extra for tip - unless you get flowers you will need thirty) and go get some much deserved pampering. 

Dear Paulene - my toes and heals thank you for the love! -- see pic ; )"
1,"I have a long history with this place, which is where I worked my first job at 16.  

It's run by two Sicilian immigrants and there 2 sons.  Originally the owners had a joint in NY, but moved to the valley and opened this place.

They run a military style kitchen where cleanliness is enforced to a maximum.  Almost everything is personally overseen by one of the two owners.

They offer a regular Italian menu... 
the regular pasta choices, nothing too fancy and no Alfredo entree.
They have some meat entrees with veal and chicken.

The pizza is NY style and really good and rich.
They offer a Garlic and Olive Oil pizza that is so good.  I get it with pepperonchinis on it.  

The crust on the Sicilian pizza is the best I've had. 

Sometimes I just crave a small cheese pizza from this joint.

The Eggplant Parmesan is in the house here, but everything holds it's own.

It's priced ridiculously well, so much so, that the senior citizens roll out from Sun City all the time.

They have a few beers on tap, all domestic, and some decent wine, but nothing fancy at all.

The bottom line is that the food is good and cheap and the place is real."
1,"Vitality Health and Fitness is a small gym that offers personal fitness, group fitness and fitness classes. The classes and the training programs are all varied, challenging, unique and fun. The members are positive, full of smiles and easy-going. The gym is not intimidating at all, the trainers are kind and build programs that suit your personal fitness levels, and the cost is VERY reasonable.  

My husband and I have been working out with Megan, and she's a doll.  We haven't gone for very long so we'll keep you posted on the impending RESULTS!

Vitality also offers nutrition and massage -- which we both plan on checking out!  The owner is delightful and easy to work with. If you have any questions or concerns about your costs or the way you are being treated, she works WITH you to ensure you are getting the level of service that you expect and that the club/program can provide. The owner is honest and respectful, fair and reasonable. I think everyone should contact this club and see if it might work for them - you won't be disappointed!"
1,"I used to go here about once a week when I still lived and worked in Arizona. My office at the time was within walking distance.

This is a very good Hooters location...located smack dab in the middle of Mill Avenue right next to ASU. Plenty of stores all around. 

I used to go mainly for lunches during the week with co-workers. It usually was quieter than evenings or weekends. The serving staff were great and many of the ladies would stand and chat for quite a while...as it was pretty slow."
1,"Considering this is the only gym I've ever been in, it's great! They have updated equipment and lots of them. I usually go during one of the busy times and can always get on a machine, or do the things I want to. Plus they have classes which are good. And every time me & my boyfriend walk in & out of the Y, a nice gal at the food counter greets us and says goodbye. We still never order anything, though...

They lose a star though because I HATE WORKING OUT!  Sigh..."
1,"My previous review has the real details about what i LOVE about their food!

Update:  Doing mostly take-out here, but at least one of the grumpy girls is more friendly now!  Yesterday when I grabbed our to-go order, she smiled, made small conversation, and did not exude a sullen disposition in any way.  I'm happy for me, I'm happy for her!

Ordered many of our usual items, plus Mongolian beef, which was very tasty. I'm stil partial to the Ginger beef, however."
0,"We were so disappointed!  We were on vacation in Scottsdale and wanted to try a Brazilian restaurant.  It was nothing like the one we have had home.  Actually it was completely worse than all three Brazilian steakhouses we have close to home.  I tried about 12 different meats and I think there were only 2 out of the 12 that were tender.  The rest were over cooked or hard as a rock.  We really wanted to love this place as I kept trying more and more of the meats as they came around hoping the next one would be better.  Besides being hard, the meats didn't have much flavor.  The salad bar was okay and I don't know that I would even pay the cheaper price to just eat from their salad bar.  This is sad that I have to say the highlight or our meal was the fresh bread and salami slice you get at the salad bar.  :("
1,"Very friendly staff, cute decor! Small, but don't let that fool you, best sandwiches ever!! The egg salad sandwich was so good, it reminded me of the egg salad I enjoyed as a kid! Their potato salad is made there and soo yummy!! Talked to the owner and she was very nice."
1,"Wow, I am very impressed. The store is very big, and they seem to have it all - even the hard to find, odd items. It looks like everyone can shop here.

The store is mapped out and sectioned nicely too. Finding things is easy, and if you can't (or don't want to) the very friendly staff are there to help. It looks like they employ people who know a thing or two about the supplements also... so whether you are looking for: digestive health, immune support, weight loss, muscle building, herbs, beauty or whatever; they have it, and they can tell you about it! Pretty Good! 

You can even get a customer rewards card and build up bonus points to get discounts and stuff. And they can track your purchases with it should you ever (like me) loose your receipt!

What I am really impressed with though is their customer service and return policy. I did not expect them to accept a return and refund my money on 2 items that I purchased there because I lost the receipt. Especially, since I did not purchase it on a member card so they could not track my purchase either. I thought I would try my luck with it anyway and was hoping for an exchange. Well, the clerk was so nice to me. She said that it was no problem and would gladly refund my money (I didn't even ask for a refund)... and I had opened one product. I was speechless and felt a little guilty about it too - since it was almost a month that had passed (I really didn't think they'd take them back). Anyway, I told her that an exchange would be more than appreciated, and she said, ""No problem:-)"" again! So I very guiltily walked over to get some of the items I needed. They had them and they had them on sale - cheaper than I have ever seen and in more of a selection too. 

Needless to say, I walked out of there very happy (but feeling a bit undeserving). But that is what good - EXCELLENT - customer service is all about - exceeding the customer's expectations! 

This I my new store for all of my supplements and health & wellness needs. I recommend checking them out. They seem to have everything one could ever need. Plus, they have an entire wall (and more) dedicated to muscle, weight and fitness - if that is your thing! Also be sure to check out their website; they even have customer reviews & ratings! and product information/facts and ingredients. Really Cool!"
1,Love it!!! Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss. Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering. If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again. YUMMY!
1,"I've ordered cookies from Cookies by Design many times and they never disappoint. I have worked with this store as well as stores across the country when ordering for the people I work with and people I love. Everyone has always said how beautiful the cookies look but even better, how great they taste. You won't be disappointed. :)"
1,"Like they even need another review - they have a solid 5 stars as it is!

Just got back from my first visit to Adobe, and I am beyond impressed. My German Shepherd pup was having some stomach issues over the holidays, so I decided to have him checked out to be on the safe side. I knew he didn't have an obstruction or other emergency issue, but I was concerned about parasites.

The receptionist, Hilary, was super sweet on the phone and in person. She was upfront with what tests she thought would be ordered, and how much it would run me (and it wasn't an arm and a leg; the office call was only $56). I was very happy they'd be able to see me the next morning, but then she called back not 20 minutes later with a cancellation and said to come on in. Even better! 

The tech was very good with Nately's 40 pounds of squirming, and loved on him the whole time. I was also happy they let me help hold him - I've been to vets that called in a 2nd tech, like the owners aren't capable of safely holding their own dog. Okay, maybe some aren't, but I am, and I appreciate being able to and not being instructed like a child.

Dr. Newland was AWESOME.

The difference between him and some other vets I've been to?
- Other vets: ""Oh my God, we need to run $500 worth of expensive tests and start him on multiple medications"", general sense of admonishment for not rushing him to their affiliated ER clinic, eagerness to run the bill up, very few questions about anything, etc... 
-Dr. Newland:  Super calm and personable. He spent 20 minutes going over everything (Nately's last few days of activity and stomach issues, diet, contact with other dogs, where I take him in public, anything he could think of really), felt his abdomen thoroughly, and said ""Honestly, he's a puppy, they eat funny things, and something probably just irritated his stomach. He's plainly feeling pretty good, so just feed him a bland diet, give him this medication to settle his stomach, and bring a stool sample just in case, so you know for sure he's parasite-free"".  He also dispensed advice for Nately's general care, as long as we were there, about heartworm prevention and  necessary vaccines, etc. I even got a good education on the different types of parasites and which were even likely in AZ's climate (turns out, not many). I really appreciated that he didn't try to frighten me into expensive diagnostics and possible serious diseases, and that he is so on his game and scientific/logical about things.

I am very impressed and will be making Adobe my regular vet for as long as possible. If only they treated birds too!"
0,"Hey Thai Elephant! Stop sucking! You used to be so good. Why is my egg roll cold? Why don't I get a fork with my food.... after asking!? Why won't you make me the Tiger on Fire for lunch when I got it last week for lunch?... AND it's on the menu! When did you decide to cut my curry portion in half almost? When did your service start sucking? Hey every person that decided that my two top was not important enough to attend! Why did it take 10 minutes to order my drink and then an additional ten minutes to actually get my drink? By the way, Tiger beer is on your menu. If you are not going to actually offer it, then you need to take it off your menu. I can't believe it's come to this... I used to love you. You broke my heart for the last time."
0,"A very inadequate meal and expensive for the low quality food you get.  Ordered the veal sorrentino and it was not enjoyable to eat.  Very dry, tough...just gross.  Caesar salad was also disgusting and unpleasant, saturated in dressing.  I did like the atmosphere, laid back and comfortable.  Knowing that Pasta Brioni is down the street, I won't go back."
1,"I'm in love. The festive dÃ©cor charmed me the second I walked in the door. We sat down and were immediately greeting by a sweet waitress carrying a basket of chips. The chips were light and fresh and came with two salsas, a red and a green avocado salsa.

We ordered: Camarones aguachile hot drowned shrimp, Camarones culichi shrimps in a green sauce,tomatill & cilantro, rezongue enchiladas crab enchiladas in a red sauce. I also ordered a club soda and when the waitress asked if I wanted it prepared mexi style I said yes. What she brought back was a delicious mix of club soda, salt and muddled lime. It's my new favorite drink. 

We patiently waited for our meal and remarked on the little mermaid scene in front of us. I almost expected the crustaceans to come to life and start playing music.  Then to our surprise little fish tostadas were dropped on our table. What a nice touch!
The dishes were excellent, all were paired with homemade tortillas, beans and white rice with vegetables.  The camarones culichi was my favorite.

Fresh seafood, fun atmosphere, great service."
1,"I love scallops, and the scallops at The Breadfruit were simply the best. On the weekend, The Breadfruit is open till 11pm and its Rum Bar is open till midnight, which makes this a great late-night haunt: pick your favorite rum drink and share a scallop appetizer for the perfect lite end to the evening. The servers were excellent and handled my gluten allergy easily, offering suggestions and slight modifications to the dishes. The Breadfruit is located at 108 East Pierce, which is south of Roosevelt and just east of First Street. Put this place as a must on your late-night hit list."
1,They have Veggie Dogs! The veggie dog will run you about 40 calories fewer than the regular turkey dog. Happy eating :)
1,"I have never eaten a regular meal here. I usually go for the reverse happy hour from 10-12pm. Cheap drinks, good food and a good atmosphere. The servers here are good. I don't eat sushi myself, but everyone I go with loves the Crunchy Crab Rolls. 

They have three different pizzas, pepperoni, BBQ chicken and cheese. I have had the pepperoni and BBQ chicken. Both were extremely good. I definitely recommend that someone looking for a good time, cheap drinks, and good food."
0,"I wouldn't go here. In fact, I looked into attending Ai of Phoenix for a graphic design degree and decided it was not the path I needed (or wanted). The decision came, though, after a couple months of trying to sort things out with them. I applied. I met with a career counselor. I had to submit some more paperwork. I went on a tour. I then was sent to meet a financial adviser, who had to be barely 18. That's when I realized that the majority of these students were young, inexperienced and knew to college life. I, on the other hand, already had a degree. I was looking to combine my past experience with a design degree to enhance my career. 

I also realized Ai isn't willing to working with professional students. They don't take into consideration your work schedule as much as they should, especially if they want to appear accommodating and understanding to students who are truly committed to going to Ai. Case in point: In order to get the ""a-ok"" to take only 9 credit hours a semester, I would have had to get the permission of the Graphic Design Faculty Advisor - or something. Ai really pushes a full-time schedule on its students, even if they offer evening classes. Silly. 

Plus, I didn't like being treated like an idiot. I mean, do I have to tell you over and over again that I already have a degree, that I know what to expect from paperwork and financial aid? Can you not see I'm annoyed at some 18 year-old who can't operate a computer to tell me what my cost would be per semester? Can you not tell I'm irked when I make known I'm on my lunch break, and I'm told it'll be another hour before we're finished? I don't like somebody wasting my time. True, I can be impatient. But this was ridiculous.

That's when I decided this place wasn't for me. Sure, I've heard great things about it, but the people who have gone here have told me I could have gotten a comparable degree and built a better portfolio somewhere else. 

Enough said."
1,"LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!  always need to find a reason to drive so far to Chandler:-)  so fresh, soup delish, and sauces yummy!!! BYOB, and casual...feels like my grandmas:-)"
1,Great place.  Hard to see behind Carl's Jr. on Southern Ave but is Worth finding!
1,"I read that the guy who owns GoDaddy shot an elephant...at night...using spotlights...I'm thinking his fully tumescent ""manhood"" must be the size and color of a 7 year old raisin...I can't imagine what he thought he was proving by felling one of these magnificent creatures with high powered/laser sighted rifle from 500 yards away, while it stood transfixed by the spotlights glare.

There was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer, when I was a kid back in Oregon...""Asshole"".

He did prove to me that I will need to move any and all business I can away from GoDaddy...""vote with your feet""...but I guess that's another review.

The Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us!

At the very tippy top of the ""near and dear"" list is our lovely daughter, Whitney.

Whit is a Vegan...with a capital ""Vege""...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist.

So she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case!

I am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare rib-eye...I don't think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart!

I checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing!

We ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynami's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich!

Even after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week!

The big question about Green is ""why didn't I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?""

I don't know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye t-shirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again.

I like to ""fit in"".

The menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma's (always a big deal for me) are both exotic and welcoming.

I didn't have to break out the bacon (although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary).

I really could eat this way on a regular basis...it's that good...I probably won't, but it's nice to know I could!

I imagine that Karma will have it's own way of dealing with a self-justifying, trigger happy technotard...for me, the occasional dinner at Green nicely balances the Karmic forces at work in my life...and tastes good, too!"
1,"The Original Burrito Co. is quickly becoming my favorite burrito place. The owner came to eat at the restaurant I work at and she told me to come by and try this place out and being a huge fan of Mexican food I had to go. The burritos are really huge and really well priced. I love the California burrito with Chicken, add guacamole. The chicken is so moist and tender. I have tried the carne asada as well, but when I got it it was full of cilantro and jalapenos, which were just overbearing, but I'm thinking it could have been a bad day and will have to try it again. Downside for me would be that the salsa is not spicy at all. It tastes very good, but I am a huge fan of spicy, especially on Mexican food, and its a bummer for me when a place does not offer a very spicy salsa."
1,"I enjoyed a pleasant lunch here with my carefree grandparents-in-law who recommended Tonto as a delicious place. When we first entered the I thought it might be full of retirees and rich Arizonians but I was pleasantly surprised to find a crowd of all sorts enjoying lunch on the outdoor patio overlooking a pretty view of the golf course and elegant Saguaros. Elegantly Casual American describes Tonto. 

Indeed it's pricey, but the food is fresh, creatively presented and delicious. (Extra pluses for using locally-sourced ingredients) 
I enjoyed the Mexican white shrimp tacos. The petite shrimp comes drenched in a sassy ancho chili green pepper sauce, complemented by a cool and zesty cabbage-carrot-cilanto slaw, avocado cream sauce and chewy homemade white corn tortillas. The fun is getting to assemble your own tacos. I ate nearly every bite and was stuffed for most of the day. 

My companions enjoyed the Reuben sandwich (layered corned beef on crispy rye, served with skinny fries that don't need ketchup) and the Halibut served on potato cake with spinach and carrot salad. Grandma-in-law said the halibut was tender and flavorful. I can imagine a bunch of friends or foodies mingling and laughing, sipping wine in relaxed delight as you drink in the beautiful view. 

Worth a visit, whether you're a local foodie or traveler."
0,I've been here twice for lunch. It's okay but I won't be coming back. The portions are small. I had one of the curries and it was good. But I had the pad thai which the menu said contains chicken and shrimp. Not a single shrimp on the plate. Cheap bastards. One of the lower quality Thai restaurants I've been to in Phoenix next to Thai Hut.
1,"I first heard about gangplank at the Arizona Entrepreneurship Conference last year.  Since then I have been a regular there and the people that co-work or work there are some of the most inspirational ones I know and are passionate about bringing start-up culture to Phoenix area.

0,"10:30pm on a Saturday night.  My friend and I try our second attempt at sushi for the night (see my review of Pearl for the first).  Place is hopping.  We take a seat at the sushi bar.

The Waitress:  ""Are you girls going to be ordering sushi?""
Me: I have a sushi menu in my hand, ""yes.""
Waitress:  ""Would you mind putting it in soon because they want to go home too.""
Me: What the fuck, bitch. ""Uh, ok""

Dear Ra Waitress,

I'm sorry if I kept you or any other employess, especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed.  It was completely ok to rush me, even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine.  I was hardly the last customer in there.  There were people all around me ordering sushi, so I'm still unclear as to why you needed to rush me.  If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food?  Maybe it was because you don't know how to count, since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot.  I like Ra for the atmosphere, something you completely ruined.  Thanks for that.   

Sincerely,
Morgan"
0,"Ok first off, with the demise of Soma and the fact that Green is in Tempe.....this place is a welcome sight, and I know I'll be back. The food is excellent. However I feel that Dr Weil has has has the wool pulled over his eyes by Mr. Fox. Come one ""Anazazi Beans"" and a drink called the ""Medicine Man""? Really- as an American Indian rights advocate you'd think we'd be past this. Actually, you'd think educated white men with lots of money would be past this --but ya know. Just because Anazazi really refers to Ancestral Pueblo people who lived mainly in NM and N. AZ and means ""ancient enemy"" in Navajo so that term isn't used by nearly ANYONE anymore...means that you probaby shouldn't call your dish by that name. Other than that- I give em props for trying.

I recently had another experience there where EVERYTHING was going wrong that night, and the staff recovered....kinda. My advice, shape up if ya wanna last."
1,"I don't know what it is about Tempe Sales, but how can you not love them? it is primarily a fabric store, and they may or may not have all kinds of other random stuff, like carved wooden chairs, stone tabletops, bamboo flooring (sadly no longer in stock), slate tiles, and so on.

However, I would say that it's not merely the random selection of home decorating supplies and upholstery tools/materials that makes Tempe Sales great. It's the family-run vibe that you get from them. On one trip, to pick up several cases of flooring material, I had to go with the owner Alan to his warehouse down the street. In light of buying as much as I did and helping pull it from the warehouse, he threw in plenty of sublayment material for free (otherwise on closeout). The staff (many of whom are part of the family) have also helped me reupholster furniture and work on plenty of other odd jobs. There is no shame in being an amateur at Tempe Sales, even though it is primarily geared toward professionals.

If you're in the market for fabric, please do yourself a favor and check it out. I bet that you will return soon thereafter just to browse around some more. The only downsides that come to mind also make the experience more interesting -- stock levels are not always reliable and parts of the store have historically been disorganized (much better now than in the past), but my experience may be skewed since I gravitate toward closeout deals."
0,"My husband and I ate here for lunch as we were waiting for our room to be ready (we were checking in early).  The restaurant is very inviting and I liked the decor.  We had a great window seat the overlooked the outdoor terrace and the mountains in the background was lovely!    The hostess was very friends and our waiter was attentive and fairly personable.  

I ordered the Beet & Goat Cheese salad with Grilled Chicken and it was quite good!  Even though I liked it very much, I would only give it a 3 out of 5 because they didn't use Roasted Beets...I believe that they were canned beets.   Still good, but roasted beets would have knocked it out of the park!  The salad had spinach, mild goat cheese, mandarin oranges, red onion, and delicious candied pecans....with a balsamic vinaigrette.  It was a very good salad.  I wished I had ordered the small serving though because it was a large salad!  The 

My Husband ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with fries.  The fries were SO good!  The sandwich was equally good, but spicy from the roasted pablano that was on it.

Net-net....it was a very good lunch, but I can only give it 3 stars because it cost us $40 for a salad, a sandwich, a soda (I had water),and gratuity.  For $40.00 for lunch, it should have been outstanding, not just very good.  I get that it's in a resort, but still."
1,"This is a bit far from us, but we went and we had a great time. I loved browsing the local goods, and the fact that it's pet friendly was a huge plus in our book. The old lady who our dog sniffed, on the other hand, should probably take a chill pill. I also got a great bunch of fresh basil from this place, which had excellent aroma and taste."
1,"This is a great Radio Shack.  The staff are older, and very knowledgeable with their product line.  If you need odd batteries, check this store out first.  I needed a watch battery, and found that they were the only store in Phoenix to carry it.  It cost be all of $5 bucks, but saved me having to buy a new watch."
0,Their amazing prices are instantly countered by despairing customer service.  If I want low prices I will go to goodwill over this place.  Looks like Dillard's is on my list of do not shop.
1,"I love this place!  Great quality food, great service, large portions and fare prices.  In the Fry's parking lot.  Try the bbq pork egg foo young, mongolian beef and get the lo mein instead of rice.  Good stuff."
1,"More expensive than some of the other nearby locations ($5 military lot next door) The shuttle was nice and quick shuttle despite odd hours of the night. Nice enough, they also accepted competitor coupons when the lot with the deal was full. The boyfriend and I had a great experience and prompt service at all hours of the night. It also seems more secure. Loved it!"
1,"Wow, I am kinda suprised by the recent reviews of this place. My girlfriend loves this place and has been going for the past 5+ years. She would probably give it 5 stars. I really like this place, the atmosphere, we always get great service. The food is really, really good and the prices aren't bad. Sometimes, very crowded, but haven't ever waited too long. We love going back and can't wait till our next visit."
1,"What a wonderful night. It didn't start out that way. I found this restaurant on yelp, not realizing that it was sixteen miles from the hotel my wife and i were staying at. I heard the grief all the way there. ""Come on honey, it's an adventure!"". 

We arrived, and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table. Zach, our waiter, was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers. We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious! 

I explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special ""gluten free"" menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat. Zach even brought us some special wheat-free dipping sauce for the Summer rolls. He showed great care, provided great customer service,  and the sauce  was delicious!

The portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful. But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special. Oh, the bathrooms were clean too. Thanks Zach, and thanks Malee's. It was a great night my wife and I look forward to repeating. (Yes, she admitted after dinner that the drive was worth it.)"
0,"Goddess got it right.  This place is pretty, and it looks so promising.  Big disappointment.   There was nothing for vegetarians.  The food was mediocre at best.  I'd choose Pho Nhat over this pretty restaurant any day.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  No good."
1,"I've always wanted a family friendly jeweler.  Esp. if my at the time boyfriend was going to buy me an engagement ring.  It means so much to me to have the true customer service when buying fine Jewelry, someone I can trust.  And when I found this place one day while I was at CVS I knew I had found a Gem (pun intended)! Peggy really made me and my now finance feel like we were family.  She helped him pick out my fabulous ring and answer every single one of his questions.  I'm so proud to tell everyone where we got the ring from because I think everyone should know about this place!  If your looking for great jewelry with a warm smile, head on over.  They are so excited to help you!"
0,"So normally I'm not that tough on places, but I think when you're serving Mexican food in Phoenix, there is a certain level of expectation.

They get one star for having decent service and another star for having quite good portions.  

On the other hand, the food was crap, especially for the price I was paying.  I had steak fajitas, not normally the cheapest thing, but for something between $12-$15 I expected something tastier.  If they had been the most delicious thing ever, I wouldn't have cared but I didn't even take the half of the food I had left home.  The steak had a funny after taste and a lot of my onions were burnt.  The beans were mediocre and tortillas were average.  

On the whole, it was a decent dining experience but not what I would have wanted for the price.  You can get a lot better Mexican food in Phoenix (and for a lot cheaper).  I'd recommend coming here only if it's the most convenient place."
0,"I so wish you could do 3 1/2 stars.  i would give it. 

Not bad chinese.  NYC style.  If you have lived in or around NYC you would completely understand.

I LOVE the Fried Dumplings.  SO GOOD!!  Highly recommend them.  Pork Lomein is good to.   Take out for sure.  Not really a place to sit and eat.  you can do it but it is more geared for take out."
1,"i like the ooey gooey cupcake! the chocolate cake is soooo moist and cooked evenly in perfection. only it's served chilled? it's weird. 

their cookies are good, too. I bought a tub of their easter sugar cookies and they are so stinking cute! they're very sweet though so it's impossible to eat more than 2 per day but soo good. anymore than that you'd need insulin. :)"
1,"Went here for the first time for xmas dinner.  Atmosphere was very chill.  Almost felt mafiosa style at times. It is a mellow setting and very relaxing with unique music.  They also have TONS of sports related everything to keep you're eyes busy while you're enjoying your meal.  

Our server was awesome, we got our food very fast and everything was excellent.  I recommend getting the 12oz filet.  It was right up there with other top shelf steak houses in the area and reasonably priced.

We will definitely be going back to Don and Charlies."
0,"To even admit to serving tex-mex is the first clue about how bad the food is there.  And whoever that nit wit was that said Arizona has bad Mexican obviously knows nothing about Good Mex food.  Ill admit right from the start that I don't want authentic Mex. food.  Go on down to Nogales and get some authentic Mex. food Ha!  What I want is authentic valley of the sun sonoran style Mex. food the way its evolved for a hundred years from the early Mexican Legal Immigrants.  Ihave been all over the USA and true you can get some decent mex food in cal, new mex., west texas.  But to get the best Beans, enchiladas, red, green, chile, tamales tortillas you have to get it right here in AZ.  Here are a few great places.  Don Joses, Matador, Carolinas. Manuels, Some Burro, Juans, Ajo Als, Macayos.  The two best are Ricardos and Papagayos, oops,  They closed because the new management wrecked the food and drove away the faithful.  And thats THE TRUTH, from ""The Truth"" Ciau!"
0,"Stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon for a milkshake when my sister was visiting from out of town. We browsed the racks of vintage clothing and costume jewelry before sitting down at the bar. It was difficult to choose our milkshake flavor, given the dizzying array of syrups and ice cream combos, but after settling on chocolate and wild cherry, we were very pleased. Plus it was a cheerful looking thing, topped with whipped cream, colorful sprinkles, and a cherry.
I was not as pleased with the service... it wasn't busy until after we sat down, but no one took our order or even gave us a menu or a ""hello"" until we'd been sitting for about 10 minutes. A party of 8 or so, including a bunch of indecisive kids, sat down AFTER us, and were served before my sister and I... and no acknowledgement of the wait. While we waited, I did enjoy looking at all the cool decor from the past, though I think the whole place could be a little bit cleaner."
0,"Thai??? Really?? I love Thai food and couldn't be happier to try a new restaurant. Wow! It was a slap in the face on so many levels. The 2 hostesses were the rudest I have had the displeasure of having to interact with. We ordered take out and as we waited for out food from the kitchen the hostesses made us uncomfortable... As if we were imposing on there entry.
The food was not spectacular. We ordered pad Thai , was very dry but not horrible. The sweet or sour beef was watery and seemed more like fajita with way too many peppers. No  sticky rice, green papaya salad, Larb..."
1,"I realize L&L is a chain, but I love their food. My favorites are the Loco Moco and the BBQ Chicken. I also enjoy their haupia-filled donuts. The family that runs this place is very friendly and do a great job in making sure you will enjoy your meal. Go there."
1,"Southern hospitality? Yes ma'am (or Mister)  :)

The first thing that struck me was that my server had a lovely accent. 
My daughter looked at me & asked me if it was part of her job to fake an accent,,,, I went with no. I'm not sure where it's from, but it's a 'honey & y'all' accent :D She had a very friendly disposition & made our lunch experience a pleasure. She made her mama proud. 

The food was decent AND you can have breakfast all day. I love having breakfast for dinner, so that's a big selling point to me :)

The building is fairly new, not too brightly lit & clean. 

In all honesty I would have given them an A OK rating, 3 stars, but our server pushed them to a 'yay! I'm a fan', 4 star rating. 
Good people make the difference!"

1,"I love the Drybar at the Scottsdale Quarter, so when I saw a Groupon for the new Phoenix location, I bought it right away. 

The salon was very busy but I was seen right away. I received my champagne promptly and went to the washing station. The Groupon was good for a 10 minute floater (scalp massage), but I can't imagine mine was for more than 5 minutes. It was a nice bonus, but not something I'd pay for myself next time I visit. 

I have simple, short hair, so my blowout was pretty quick. The woman who did my hair did a great job of listening to what I wanted and was a lot of fun to talk to. 

I was in and out within 40 minutes. It only lasted about a day, so that was a bummer, but my hair stayed clean and fresh for four. 

Drybar is a step above other blow dry bars in the area - I highly recommend!"
1,Great place to go before heading to the zoo. Not a lot of seating if you're with a big party
1,"I used to frequent Homme for Tuesday night karaoke, Friday night French Kiss, and spent Saturday nights upstairs. I have to say that for the sheer, unimaginable amount of times I wastedly bowled over the dance floor, tumbled down the stairs, or made out with someone I never intended to, Homme has never done me wrong. The bartenders on both floors are fantastic, though the upstairs is better tailored for more intimate lounging. I've been to countless events here, and they've been well-organized and (as far as I can remember) really fun. There' s a great crowd here, and you won't feel like you're dancing in a dirty, sweaty shoebox like other hip dives in the valley. 

The parking situation is shady on weekends. I recommend going early to avoid irrational towings and cover charges; while it's purportedly not socially acceptable to leave the house before 10p, you'll be glad you did."
1,"I'm pretty much in agreement with the previous five reviews.  A great way to spend the day when it's hitting over a hundred degrees!  It's about a forty-five minute drive from Phoenix.

I went on a Saturday afternoon, around three or so.  So, I missed the huge crowds and rowdy bunch, along with the sun at it's hottest point!  It's about a two to three hour ride from the shuttle drop off point two to the pick up point four.

Rentals are $14/pp, which includes your tube rental and shuttle service.  This is the all day rate, so if you get there in the morning, you can go back again and again.  It's $10/pp without the tube rental.  You can also rent a tube for your ice chest (styrofoam coolers are not recommended as they float away), which is a must as you need to load up on TONS of water and your beverage of choice.

Bring along tons of sunblock and reapply often.  Bring a hat though because you'll be glad you did when you see all the sunburn faces around you.  A few old bedsheets will feel like a godsend on your hot tube, so think about bringing those along too!  And bring along a pair of cheap water shoes or old sneakers because it's definitely rocky and you will need to climb out of the river at the end.  Flip flops or loose sandals are not recommended as you see them floating on by in the fast current.  (Don't be foolish and bring your new expensive sunglasses aka 'spies' to show off because you'll look like an idiot when you lose it!)

And yes, the river is dirty - with river grass, pee, marshmallows, every other kind of food possible, etc.  But you hope with the quick current flowing, that it makes the water less dirty...you hope at least.  And please take your trash with you!  (The shuttle drivers offer decent plastic trash bags for free, so please take a couple with you on the river!)

They require that children be a minimum of 8 years old AND four feet tall before they'll allow you on the shuttles to take you down to the river.  It can be a fast river, but also because of the mostly high school and college aged crowd frequently and dominating the river.

It's open 9 am to 7 pm, seven days a week.  The last tube rental is at 4 pm, and lost tubes will cost you $20 each.  You need a driver's license for every four or five tube rentals.  And no glass containers!  Your ice coolers will be inspected before you're allowed to board!

We're on the lookout for more rivers to float on!"
0,"I didn't go back again.  The haircut turned out to be worse than I thought, being quite unmanageable.  I ended up going back to the local Mexican barber, who charged 12 bucks for a pretty decent haircut.

I think they gave better massages than they did haircuts.  Still, it wasn't a bad place, and one could do worse."
1,"The quintissential downtown scottsdale club. As snobby as it gets, but in an endearing way. I talked to Ice T and Coco at this club one time. For some reason I felt like I always was on the verge of punching somebody when I was in there. This place reminds me of the club in the beginning of American Psycho, reserved tables, the whole deal."
1,This spicy chicken soup is a must have when sick. Always makes me feel better when my hubby brings it home for me.
1,"Absolutely LOVE the ambiance - very romantic with the brick and stone and walls of wine. The fireplace and comfy seating make it very intimate. In my opinion, the best time to come here is for brunch. Yes, even on a Sunday nursing a hangover, the food, drink and decor can't be beat. Very reasonably priced mimosas and bloody's as well as some of the best breakfast items you could ask. My fave is the eggs benedict with thier Mexican twist - the carne adovada is also amazing and very satisfying. No skimping on the meat here, and it's not drowning in sauce - I have yet to finish a full plate of anything. Thier potatoes even get my mouth watering.  

Service was great the last time we went, but the first time we had to go up to the bar to remind the gal we were there. After that she was more than attentive and the food more than made up for it. I could linger here for hours and get in some serious trouble! 

Have not been to the downstairs area or had any other meal here, but can't wait to go back!!!"
1,"Do you like trendy shit-music and half dressed plastic surgery queens gyrating all around you, while you pay twelve dollars for your appletini? If your answer is yes, don't bother coming here. 

Dive bars are plentiful in Phoenix, but the Bikini is in my 'hood. It's a dirty, unassuming place, with a couple of no-nonsense bartenders and a good jukebox. 

There are a couple of rules to follow when visiting the Bikini: 

1. Bring cash. Cards aren't accepted, the atm machine is there for decoration only, as it hasn't worked in at least two years. 

2. Don't make fun of the guy in the overalls and farmer hat. He's my neighbor. 

3. Don't piss off the bartenders. Tip them well, treat them nicely, and don't order more than three dirty martinis. If you are nice to them, they will be nice to you. This includes, but is not limited to: the strength of your drinks, the price of your drinks, and whether or not you get a drink at all. They take no shit. 

If you can't handle it, stay away. The place gets crowded enough as it is."
0,"I came in here wanting and expecting this place to be amazing.  I wanted this place to be 5 stars. ugh, I feel like a failure for giving it 2.  I've heard such good things about this place, and was expecting it to be good, but unfortunately, it was not.  :-(

I walked in and placed my order.   The menu seems to be decent enough, with a fair amount of selection.  Ample amounts of toppings, and you can have your burger a few different ways. Mind you, I'm a burger lover, so I'm always up for places like this.

I ordered a regular burger with all the fixings and BBQ sauce on top.  I got the fries too.  It came in a brown bag..I guess thats how they serve it regardless if you eat in or not.

I was dissappointed with the burger itself.  It seemed like it came with way to much topping. I mean, like an overwhelming amount.  I ate it, and the burger was okay, but not as good as I have experienced at other comparable places.  I wasn't looking to be ""blown away"" by the burger, but I wasn't really impressed over all.  It wasn't that great, to much on the toppings, and it didnt really do much for me.  I will say tho, you get a TON of fries tho.

I left feeling underwhelmed, and don't know that I will be back in the future."
1,"I took a friend from Europe here this past week. I cannot express how much the attention to detail is welcomed and so wonderfully presented. By this I mean, the service, the presentation, the food, the atmosphere. The staff knows that when you walk in, you will be spending good money and they expect to take care of your whim and cater to your palette. 
The steaks are buttery, delicious and worth every bite. The sommelier made a wonderful suggestion to go with our order and he was spot on in his selection. This may not be the place to dine on a regular basis for some, but if you plan to make a special night of an occasion, I recommend highly Ruth's Chris. I have not been to the one in Phoenix, only the Scottsdale location, but I would be hard pressed to say that it would be any less tasty. 
My buddy was treated so kindly and his comment (paraphrased) was as follows: It's too bad that so much of the world hates Americans. They think that Americans are so loud and bossy. They can be so kind and so willing to to be helpful when they want. In Europe, no one cares if you are from France or Italy or Dernmark because we are like states next to each other. In America, everyone wants to know about where you are from and want to hear you talk about it and the places you have been.

Thank you to the staff for being a part of my friend's visit."

1,"DV Nail, may I help you? YES! You can - and always well. I've been going to DV Nails for years and they're great. I've ""cheated"" on them a few times when I hear of similar nail shops in the area offering specials and mini hot stone massages with a manicure but I always end up back at DV Nail. 

Their massage chairs are wonderful - strong massagers. You actually feel like you're getting worked on. They're clean, friendly and always do a great job for the price. It's not fancy by any means and I wish they'd turn on the radio instead of the fuzzy TV but they're consistently good. They carry every Essie & OPI color and my manicures always last a long time. A manicure & pedicure is $28 total + tip. I think that's great. 

I typically request Tina or Julie - they both take their time and do great. Don't be fooled by this place... there's often a long wait. I'd recommend an appointment."
1,"This was the first Thai I have had and it did not disappoint.

I went to Mint Thai with my in-laws, who love the place, so I had high expectations. It's a nice restaurant, with ample seating, and a good atmosphere. The menu can be a little intimidating. Each dish is numbered, named, and has a description, and there are something like 70+ dishes to choose from, plus spiciness options, so it can be kind of hard especially for a newbie.

I picked something in the 60s with chicken and red curry. It was really delicious, with unique flavors and a good spiciness. My only difficulty was that my food was basically swimming in the sauce. I ended up packing some up to take home, and ended up with a plate still full of sauce.

Other than that, this place was delicious. If only it weren't so far away, so I could try more of their options."
1,"Hands down, the best breakfast I've had in Tempe/Phoenix.   We arrived on a Sunday morning around 9am and had no wait for a table.  The service was friendly and attentive.  A few slip ups on forgetting things in the kitchen (e.g. bringing someone's toast), but our waitress was great.

Everyone in our party loved their food.  I had the Vatican skillet (which we still can't figure out why it's called the Vatican...?) and blueberry pancakes.  Others had the three musketeers omelette and the breakfast burrito.  All of the food was awesome.

And then there was the brandied blackberry bread pudding dessert.  Oh. My. God.  I don't even have the words to describe it.  At least not words that are appropriate for yelp.  It alone is worth a trip to this restaurant.

I'll be back.  Not soon enough."
1,"My friend who I was visiting and I went here for a fundraiser type of a deal.  I don't know what I was expecting but I really liked the island concept of the place.  My friend recommended a salad and I got a Caribbean chicken salad with some sort of coconut rice, chicken,  oranges, pineapple, tortilla strips, etc.  Well, the salad was huge!!!  The honey lime dressing was very flavorful and complimented the salad well.  We shared the rumbi fries, which were a combination of sweet and regular fries, and as aforementioned in some other reviews, I love the sweet potato fries and wish they all could have been that (do I sound like the Beach Boys?).  

The decor was pretty cute and the music was great (Marley, Buffett type stuff).  The rice bowls looked fantastic, as did the sandwiches.  The prices were pretty good, considering the amount of food you received."
1,"Good food for a good price.  First time I've eaten at this location but it was as good as I hoped.  I got a half size Crunch Roll for an appetizer, and an order of Chicken Yakisoba.  Both were very good.  The crunch roll was very fresh with good quality ingredients, crunchy shrimp Tempura, crab, avocado, etc.  The yakisoba wasn't quite what I thought it would be in that the noodles and meat were separate, not mixed, but that didn't affect the quality or flavor.  It was closing time and I'd only eaten half, but I packed up the rest and brought it back to my motel so the workers could finish up and go home. 

This was the fourth place I'd attempted to go to for dinner so I was especially happy to find them open.  The first place, Azucar Peruvian, was right across the street from the motel I always stay at and I'd been meaning to try them since last summer.  I drove over there to find they were now out of business with a sign up advertising the place going in next.  I snoozed, I loozed.

 The second place was supposed to be open till 8:30pm according to their Yelp listing, but was closed when I got there a  few minutes after 8.

The third place, Omega Gyros, highly recommended on Yelp, was also out of business.  FML. 

So when I got to Yogi's I was holding my breath till I saw they were open till nine.  Thank you Yogi's!"
1,Amazing Mexican food and the drinks are knock you on your ass good.  Have the guacamole and a madre then come and talk to me.
1,"The staff is great, the food is great, even the cappuccino is great (had my first one today).

i work close by and I have a choice where to eat and it's very often Acacia for breakfast and lunch.

A few of my favs are:

- Chicken Salad Sandwich
- Southwest Ranch Salad
- Omelets

Enjoy! (maybe I'll run into you there)"
1,"Checked in last night with a large group of people and gotta say: the staff is super professional and very nice. Clean, quiet rooms. Amenities are quite as nice as the Marriott (small pool), but there is free WiFi (connection is good and consistent) and breakfast and dinner snacks come with your room. So, good value."
1,"Went back, they appeared to have remodeled and noise level was greatly reduced.  Food, atmosphere, everything still wonderful.  In my first review, I stated ""the only reason I'm giving it less than 5-stars is because of the noise level.""  As the noise level issue appears to have been rectified, my review is subsequently being modified to reflect this.

Last time I was there I had a salmon salad, which was good though in all honesty the salmon was the star of the dish.  I asked the server to please ask the chef how the salmon was cooked so such perfection.  I honestly did not expect for any type of response.  Lo and behold, a gentleman came out and explained the procedure utilized to get that sear and texture without overcooking or under-cooking the salmon.

Re: Another reviewer's issue with ""soggy fried calamari""
It is tempura calamari, which is different from other ways to fry the calamari.  I have never had any issues with sogginess unless I leave it to sit for too long.  Hmm...  Clearly, they prefer Zinc Bistro.  Honestly, I haven't been to Zinc Bistro so I cannot draw a comparison at this time between the two.

I will definitely go back as soon as I can to The Greene House -- Oh, loved the recent press on the Chef's high praise, it *is* well deserved!"
0,"Staying here in lieu of getting a real apartment.  

Pros:
There is someone making my bed.
Location.
Eye candy (they got something right).  Girls are smokin. 
Valet.
  
Cons:
I have a rental car but for nights out, where are the taxis?  You would think paying $250/night 5 nights a week, you would think they'd call one for me.  When I called front desk, they told I can catch one downstairs.  No, I do not want to stand out front in the cold and wait fot the parking attendant to holla one for me.  
Very small rooms - No couch or real sitting area.
And what?!  No tubs except for the suites. 
No jacuzzi?
Gym - is that treadmill falling apart?  No, it's just someone using it.
Bliss lotion (smells great but useless) - all this dry weather, I have to BYOL.  
Room service (food and wine by the glass)...more variety please."
1,"Best breakfast in the valley. Dinner sucks. Well, let's clarify a bit here. We've ordered blueberry pancakes, stuffed french toast, muffins, and a few other b-fast items. They were all stupidly good. For dinner, we've tried a couple dishes such as the recommended jumbalaya - SUCKS! Stay away from that canned garbage. Back to breakfast...dang, that's incredible!"
1,"In the interest of full disclosure the only thing I every really go here for is the lunch buffet but wow, what a great buffet! I believe the buffet itself is about $10 and for that you get a wide range of vegetarian items and as with other items on the buffet most of those get changed out over time so you get a rotation of various dishes as you come back. They also have hummus and baba ghanoush (like hummus but made with eggplant instead of chickpeas). There is generally at least one dish with red meat (today it was a tomato based stew with eggplant and either beef or lamb) and usually two dishes with chicken.

I generally get iced tea to go with the meal and one thing to note, they do not serve alcohol so if you want to go someplace where you can also have a drink or two, this would not be a good place to go but if you just want a place with really good Middle Eastern food (the owners told me it is really Lebanese cooking but I'm going to just generalize and say for most of us, when you try it, you will think Middle Eastern). Of course, you can walk a block or two to 4 peaks brewery, in the same area, and have a drink or two before or after you your meal. 

One really nice thing about this place it is right off the Apache stop on the light rail and right across the road (same side of the street) is Pita Jungle so a wide range of good food options right off that light rail stop.

Bottom line, I've never had anyone I've taken here NOT like it and everyone who has gone has wanted to go back again. I like it for lunch during the workday because it is quick and you have a wide variety of regularly changed out tasty food options, so I recommend you give it a try if you have the time. :-)"
1,"Very very nice family owned bookstore that allows you to trade in your books and buy other books for half price. The owners have also recommended many books/authors to my family over the years.

I came in today still seeking a book that I have gone to numerous libraries looking for. I found a copy on the shelf that was much bigger than an ordinary paperback. I asked if they might have any additional copies. The owner was so nice and went in the back room not once but twice to find me the book and it's sequel. I was so thrilled to have found the books!

I believe that almost every year they have a book clearance where they sell off many books for only $1. I won't be in town for it but if anyone is, I recommend checking it out!"
0,It was just okay for me. Pizza was huge which was great for the price. I would eat there again.... But it would not make my top 10 favorites.  It has nothing that stands out to me as a wow factor.  Wings were good.
1,"Best pizza in the valley that I've had (I've yet to do Pizzaria Banco).  Great service, always made fast, and GREAT pricing...doens't travel well, so if you're gonna have it in your car for a while I wouldn't recommend it...I think that's why there's a lot of ""soggy crust"" comments etc..."
0,"The sign also bills itself as 'Santa Fe style' food. Having lived many years in New Mexico, with a family - generations of which are from New Mexico - the cuisine was decidely not New Mexican. It was standard Sonoran.

With that said, the meal was quite enjoyable. The enchilada sauce had a nice flavor. The dulce de leche was fantastic. The service was very good. The decor was a little non-descript, but that's OK, All in all, a nice addition to the meager choices for Mexican food in Surprise.  We would probably come back.

I had to give it 3-stars because of what it is not. If you are looking for Spanish food - there is none here. If you are looking for New Mexican style-cuisine, you won't find it either. 

However, if you are looking for a decent, enjoyable meal at a local family-owned establishment, this is a good choice."
0,"Bad food, but lots of it.  If you have a hangover and need grease, this is your place.  Other than that, drive a block and eat at Mucho Gusto down the street--now that is real mexican food!"
0,"Ok, Stingray has it's high points. It's trendy, hip, and might just explode with young, beautiful people. The atmosphere and decor are nice, but that doesn't completely make up for the fact that the sushi simply falls around the mean. It's average. The menu has a nice selection of rolls and other dishes, and they're good, just not...great. We had a couple different specialty rolls, a tofu dish, soft shell crab, and tempura. Overall it was fresh and well-presented and halfway between actually authentic Japanese and some American Asian fusion food. The bar is crowded if you grab drinks while waiting and the bartenders weren't really fabulous in any way. Same goes for the servers who lack attentiveness and decorum in general. For a place with such a wait, huge crowds, and pretentious hostesses, I'd expect a little more. The curved booths along the sides are nice, though. Oh and, beware, in regards to the well-earned and deserved ""scene"": you might just see/run into every person you want (and don't want) to on a Saturday night."
1,"Was at Zinc again last night and have to say the place keeps getting better still.  Started with the crepes again, perfect again.  Then shared the scallops and lamb shank for dinner.  I'm not usually a huge fan of lamb OR scallops but they were recommended and I was feeling adventurous.  The lamb -  AMAZING.  Melt in your mouth wonderful.  More like a stew than anything with classic fall off the bone tender meat over creamy cheesy polenta.  Their bread is perfect French bread too.  This time of year (winter) there is a festive, buzzy energy with a good crowd but not TOO long of a wait.  Make reservations though for sure.  Oh, and Bobby's across the way in Kierland is a nice spot for a pre-dinner drink (400s Hollywood glamour meets The Jetsons with cool live jazz your parents or grandparents would have enjoyed back in the day)."
0,"I'll go easy because they just opened this location.

1)  The onion ring batter won't stay on the onion.  The onion was a bit raw too.  Try soaking the rings for 24 hours in buttermilk.  Then coat twice.  Season the flour with garlic and pepper.  Works for me!

2)  The happy hour menu is weak!.  Pretty much chips and snacks type stuff.  Nothing good like sliders etc.

3)  The kids mac & cheese is out of a box.  Really guys?  It takes two seconds to make mac  & cheese from scratch.  Go to allrecipes.com if you need help.

4)  The burger meat is good in flavor but the burger lacks seasoning.

5)  The menu is way too big.  A scaled down menu with better quality would be better.

6)  The nachos are nasty with that queso cheese.  People love traditional nachos.  Stack them high and layer them with cheddar.  all the toppings.  You are a sports bar.

7)  IMO.. drop all of the steaks etc from the menu.  You're a sports bar.  Leave that to Mastros and Flemings.  People want GOOD bar food in a sports bar.

Bottom line....  love the atmosphere, food is OK, beer was cold, price is a little high for what you get, menu is too big, quality of food is OK.  What would I do?  Interview a new fresh Chef to bring in some changes.  

Good luck.  I'll stop by again for a happy hour and give you another try.  Cheers."
1,We were greeted with very friendly staff.  We had the fried knocci for an appetizer with a fabulous marinara sauce - usually do not order knocci but these came recommended and were very good.  The bread was crusty on the outside & chewy on the inside -very yummy.  We sat at the bar as we usually do and the bartender brought over a sample of their meet sauce to try with more bread.  I don't eat meat sauce but my husband said it was very good.  I had a heft cosmo & my husband had a beer.  For dinner i had the pasta trio that was fabulous - probably the best italian food i've had since the cioppino at Allesia's restaurant.  My husband had the linguine with white clam sauce also very good.  I'm certain these pasta dishes were homemade because they just had amazing flavor - I wanted more!! We finished with tiramisu that was also really great.  My husband had coffee and even that was great.  A little pricey in my opinion for italian food but due to how great all of it tasted -  we think it was worth it.  This will be a definite dining destination in the future.
0,"I thought I had reviewed this location already?  Weird.  The one closer to the mall is a total hassle since it is crowded with no parking so it is much better to go here instead (even if you are actually shopping at the mall).  You all know about the food and you either love it or you hate it but I just like this location since there is usually not much of a line, at least in the evenings."
1,"I love this place, so cute and trendy, and great food! love the crepes but my fav is the BBQ pork sandwich. its so flavorful with avocado.
Pastries are great too. Great place for lunch or afternoon tea."
1,"The best part about this place is the cozy atmosphere. We took our dog with us for dinner, and we were able to sit on the patio. So if you have a four legged family member, this is a nice chill place, with very good service. 

I had the Crab Cake BLT, and although it sounds unappealing, it was surprisingly good. My better half had the Windsor Burger, but commented that the burgers at Deluxe are much tastier. 

The signature drinks are decent, but definitely on the sweet side. There appeared to be a good wine and beer list, which I will most likely opt for next time.  

Bottom Line: I would go back without hesitation."
1,"I came to Timo for my birthday last week after hearing rave reviews about it from a few friends of mine. I met up with the fabulous Jennifer T. and I was so happy to check this place out!

I like any place that I get to walk in through a back door. I passed through the very chill looking patio area first, another plus in my book. Plenty of outdoor seating that looked dangerously inviting once this hot hot heat cools off. Inside was intimate, but with the large windows, it wasn't dark and depressing. Like your own little happy wine bar world.

They have an amazing wood burning oven. Normally, that itself is plenty good enough, but then there's the food that comes out of that wonderful oven. I only tried the spinach and artichoke dip, which was the best I have ever had! It didn't have a pool of oil (first time for everything!), it was so fresh, and I really appreciated seeing the bread sliced fresh right in front of us, since we were sitting at the bar. I saw several other things (flatbread)  come out of that oven, and I will have to go back to try them! Everything smelled delicious and was presented with a touch of class without being pretentious. I was also very intrigued by the eggplant dip which is apparently ""better than baba!"" 

Now for the drinks. Holy cow. I've been drinking a few years now, so safe to say, I've tried many, many drinks. Or so I thought. Coconut mojito anyone!? Made with Ciroc Coconut vodka!  As tasty as mojitos are, I don't get a long well with rum, so vodka was a pleasant surprise, and the coconut just brought the mmmmmazing factor to a whole new level. I also tried the white sangria, another 5 stars. Great wine list too- Apothic Red is one of a few reds I like, and they have it!  

The staff was top notch as well. I arrived shortly before a shift change, and both bartenders were personable and hard working, and truly seemed to enjoy what they were doing. I'm pretty bad with names unfortunately, or I would love to mention them.

I can't wait to go back! For drinks and food! I think I'd even go alone for lunch if I didn't have any company!"
0,"Typically I give a place that falls in the middle of great and bad multiple chances.  For whatever reason it's easier for me to 1, 4 or 5 star a place after the first visit, rather than 3.  As far as yelp is concerned, 3 stars isn't a bad thing - ""A-OK.""!

The scene is strange.  It's a mix of typical Arcadia, Scottsdale and the like.  This place is more of a sports bar than anything, in my eyes, with better food than your typical sports bar fare.  Seriously.  There's like 14 televisions in here.

Service is quick-ish.  Food is fresh.  The servings are very large.  Some things waver on decent-to-bland, while other things are pretty swell.  The mac & cheese is a pass, in my opinion, and not worth the $5 (for the small cup you get - ah, contradictory to my large servings note!).  Some dishes have an overpowering taste, while other leave you wondering if you're eating food or chewing crunchy water (that sounds gross now that I've typed it out!).

Beer and liquor list is pretty typical; nothing to note really.  A few changes here and there and I could see it as a really decent spot.  The same could be said for the food, really.

I'll be back, yet again, The Garage just hasn't blown me away yet.  Also, on a funnier note: ""Garage"" reads easily as ""Garbage"" on the menu, which was kind of comical."
0,Experience with Hostess was rude. Service with a frown. Our waiter had attitude too. It was a birthday dinner and we were in great spirits..so this review is written with clarity. The margaritas were strong-check ok there. The shrimp appetizer was different and very good and $18 for four shrimp. We ordered two mahi mahi dinners (each $24)and they were RANCID. Yup. I said RANCID. We asked if the shrimp fajitas dinner had the same jumbo and they said they would have to charge extra (each entree was priced at $30) we had to pay extra for the beans and rice that they had left on the table-which was cold by the time the shrimp dinner--which came with 5 shrimp and onions.  Poor service with an attitude. Mediocre food to say the least...all over-priced. Never going back.
1,"MMMMM. Let me break it down for you...when you can hear staff in the kitchen saying ""oh wow, that looks amazing"" as plates are coming up in the window, you're in for a treat. I mean the fact that they see these dishes time and time again and are still excited by them....! Then flash forward to the next day and if you're heating up second lunch (I like to eat) in the office micro and employees comment on the delicious smells, yeah you're doing a-ok! I was solo this time because Gabi M was home with baby Mess and I didn't think to call Jarred (sorry bud!). Eating alone certainly wasn't as much fun but it was delicious. Eggplant is a must. You just HAVE TO get it, done. In addition I also had a really yummy chicken dish with wide noodles, veggies, basil, and a spicy/sweet sauce. SO tasty. The portions are enormous, so don't balk at the prices. Grab two entrees, share with the group, take home leftovers...that simple ;).

Know Before You Go:  I'm only in Scottsdale one every other month and Tottie still remembers me when I come in, and that rocks! Big fan."
0,"I was working for a non-profit organization and Amare was actually there. He was gracious enough to take a few pictures with some of our children who are clients, which was nice of him. 

But, as far as the food goes - it's bland. I've been here on two separate occassions other than work, and while the atmosphere is beautiful (the seats and booths are roomy and comfy and there are even more seats that stretches out to the back, leading to a small ""VIP"" section), the food is just not that great."
1,"This is what I've come to expect from Waffle House. Great food with excellent customer service. My new home store since the one two blocks from my house is run by a cranky, sarcastic non-clean district manager (Kyle I was told is his name)"
1,So perfect. The atmosphere is just spot on. I love going whether it's just to grab coffee and leave or if I am there studying or just want to chill. I love their Apple Harvest (?) salad. So delicious and beautifully prepared. Baristas are always very nice (especially Brianna!). Can't wait to hopefully become a regular and attend some of the live music events they put on every week!!
1,"What's not to love? Herb n Flavors uses local, high quality ingredients, the food tastes GREAT and they are vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free friendly! I especially liked their vegan spinach and artichoke dip! We will definitely be back soon : )"
1,"Zin, zin, zin - Yes, yes, yes!
Several weeks ago five of us had a wonderful Monday evening at Zinburger with our delightful server, Candace. I arrived early, inquiring about the Left handed Polestar Pilsner, Candace offered a sample, very tasty - with three of my party eventually having it with dinner. 
We had a great booth - giving us a vantage point, watching the parade of customers & employees. I really like the airy, roomy, high energy vibe.
With our drinks we had the delicious zucchini fires with two sauces an
a subtle breading on the zucchini.
We all tried different burgers, with some of us tasting each others, Candace made the split arrangements prior to serving us - nice touch. The meat is flavorful, melting in your mouth with a freshly baked bun.
Fun, cool atmosphere & great food - made for a great get away, early in the week.
My hats off to the Sam Fox team, another winner at ZinBurger."
1,"As I revealed in a previous review, my family loves InnSuites. This location is nestled in the Squaw Peak Mountain Preserve, close to the prestigious Biltmore area, and offers easy access to downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale and the Camelback corporate corridor. 

InnSuites offers comfotable, clean rooms for a very rasonable price. And as with all of the InnSuites locations, the Northern location includes amenities such as free social hour and free hot breakfast with eggs, potatoes, waffles, toast, cereal, yogurt, fruit, coffee, milk & juices. There isn't really much within walking distance at this location, so either plan to hang around the pool a lot or you'll need to have a car."
1,"Our group enjoyed a fabulous lunch here this past Sunday. The patio is perfect for people watching on a beautiful afternoon. 

Appetizer: Crab Cakes. The guys really liked the crab cakes which appeared to be served with some sort of cream sauce with diced red and yellow bell peppers. 

Appetizer: Spinach Cheese Dip. This dip fits the standard and is served with crispy pita-esque bread pieces. 

I truly appreciate the large selection of Gardein entrees they serve for Vegetarians and Vegans that want to enjoy not-so- healthy bar grub like our omni friends. ** Be sure to note any dietary restrictions upon placing your order. I ordered the ""beef"" sliders original style and they came with cheese which was not mentioned on the menu. They gladly added a side of lettuce and the jerk and buffalo sauces to my plate. I adore there shoe string fries. 

My companions enjoyed their ahi tuna salad and steak entrees. 

As far as drinks go, there is a large menu sure to please everyone in your party!"
0,"I am not really a fan of CPK but I went here with a colleague as it was close by where we were working. I figured I would just go with a basic pizza (thin crust) and was less than impressed. For thin crust it was pretty soggy and for me that is a deal breaker. Service was good and friendly but the pizza sub-par IMO. Maybe the other items are better, but I thought I was safe going with a plain pie."
1,I read about Scramble on line so I thought I would go there for brunch and I loved it!! The Santa Fe eggs Benedict are amazing! The staff is friendly and the ambiance is incredible. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!!!
1,Still flying solo.  My friends took me for dinner here and it was excellent.  Humus appetizer was great.  For main course did broiled chicken pita wrap and it was perfect.  Recommend!
1,"Attention all parents, nannies, guardians etc.  Koko bees is tons of fun!  The kids are all smiles & full of laughter.  Terrific environment:  oodles of play houses,  dress ups, costumes, toys, themes & settings!  The little ones imaginations can run wild.  They even offer fantastic dance, sports, yoga and tumbling classes for the children!  This is a great place to come with the kiddos!!"
0,"Try as I might I cannot give this place a thumbs-up. I've likely been in D&E 30 times over the last 10 years, always wanting to 'give them another chance'. They are close-by and the food is above average. But the service ALWAYS sucks. I seriously wonder if the servers are TRAINED to ignore customers. I'm not referring to when it is BUSY, I'm talking weeknights with a very light crowd. They all must be independently wealthy, is the only thing I can guess."
1,"This hotel is amazing! The staff is very friendly, it's very  clean and it has wide space for a hotel room, nice swimming pool with a heated pool. They have free breakfast and free dinner:) and it's pretty much near with everything you need: mall, restaurants and bars:)"
0,Decent food at not unreasonable prices. The service is good. What is up with the hyper aggressive pigeons on the patio? The waitresses actually pass out squirt guns to the the customers to fend off the ever persistent waves of the foul fowl. At the end of your patio experience there is a certain sense of camaraderie shared with the other patrons.
1,"Verde = good, quick, close-by & cheap = YAY!!!!
So...We went for breakfast last week and here is the result: green chili pork: Delish!!! Tortillas: Delish!! Eggs: Yuck!! Guacamole: Good!!
The breakfast eggs are the 'fake eggs' - you know the ones that come in a pourable carton...honestly a little disappointing, because 2 sunny-side up eggs wouldve been muy bueno!!
but everything else was on-point so i just wont order eggs again! :)
we also ordered take-out this week: the whole lime-oregano rotisserie chicken it was MUY DELISH!!! This is not your grocery store rotisserie - the flavor was amazing!! the whole fam luved it and devoured it -
Verde will be my new go to when i dont want to cook dinner or when i need a quick lunch!"
0,Unfortunately this UPS location is less than friendly or helpful.  Try the location near Fry's in Fountain Hills.  They are very friendly and helpful!!
0,"Oy ve iz mir!

Not to be a kvetch....but I consider myself to be an expert on Jewish delis.  As a New Yorker from a predominantly Jewish area and married to a Jew, I've had more than my fair share of experiences at them.  My husband and I woke up this morning with a burning desire for a good bagel, corned beef on rye, and a knish.  So I schlepped all the way up to the PV Mall to get it.

Ok, first of all, the decor is terribly schlocky.  Its kind of like the tourist trap Jewish deli you find in Times Square.  Its like a Disney version of a NY deli.  

I take my number and head over to the cold case to get some drinks....of course they didn't have regular lemon Snapple (and why should they?  Its not like every deli, pizza place, and convenience store in NY carries it....) but they did have Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray which is always a welcome sight.  Another thing they had in the cold case which I found to be odd were jars of Nathan's pickles.  Nathan's, like the hot dog place.  I would imagine a Jewish deli would have Ba Tampte pickles....I didn't even know Nathan's made pickles!  It was a little lame to be honest.

Anyways, I go up to the counter where there doesn't seem to be anyone working.  There was no organization to it.  So I waited.  And waited.  In New York, the deli is a finely tuned machine designed to move people quickly.  Chompie's? Eh, not so much.  When I finally did place my order, the guy who took it had a hard time punching it into the computer and asked me to repeat it several times.  Despite saying I wanted my bagel toasted several times I was given a cold, untoasted bagel.  I waited a little longer for my order to come up and went on my merry way.  

Here is the breakdown of the food we ordered-

Matzoh ball soup- Surprisingly good.  I have never had matzoh ball soup with carrots and celery...so much chazerei!  Just give me the matzoh ball! Although, I will admit, it was solid.  I wouldn't go all the way to Chompie's for it because I know that I can make it better in my own kitchen. 

Plain bagel ""toasted"" with cream cheese- Terrible.  The bottom of the bagel was entirely too thick and was very hard.  They didn't even cut it all the way through, probably because the crust is too thick! 

Corned beef on rye- Meh.  The corned beef wasn't very good, it wasn't corned enough.  If they make their own they didn't use a piece of brisket that was fatty enough.  The rye (which was not marble rye...) was lackluster.   It couldn't handle the corned beef, became soggy, and eventually fell apart.  The pickle it came with was the grossest thing I've ever seen.  And it was definitely a kosher dill, even though I asked for a half sour.  The potato salad was actually really good though.

Knish- Terrible.  The knishes in my elementary school cafeteria were better than this.  First of all, the outer crust was way too flimsy.  It should have been much, much, thicker, especially considering the gargantuan size of the knish.  We essentially ate a large plate of mashed potatoes.  The potato inside itself was unremarkable.  Not only do I have this Jewish thing going on but I'm also Irish....I've never met a potato dish I didn't like.  Until today.  I didn't even finish my half of the knish. 

Now for the prices.  What's with this meshugas?  $2.29 for a bagel with cream cheese is a tad much.  In NY they run you about $1.35.  The corned beef sandwich was $12.50!  Now, I've paid that much for sandwiches in NY before but you get 2 lbs of meat and several layers of sandwich!  This was not a $12.50 sandwich.  I was also going to get us some whitefish salad to sample but at $15.99/lbs it wasn't happening.  

Why anyone should schlep all this way, in this heat, schvitzing all over, for this dreck?  I don't know!"
1,"Angel Sweet Gelato is a welcome treat on a hot day. It sits in a small strip in the middle of Mesa Riverview, but if you can find it (west of Logan's), it's worth a stop.

The selection of flavors is large, including a dozen dairy-free fruit flavors that aren't quite as decadent as the dairy gelatos in the left-hand case. I've tried the lemon and all the berry flavors, and haven't found anything that wasn't delicious. The prices are reasonable, and you can order sizes from one small scoop to a big box (all unfortunately served in styrofoam).

There isn't a lot of seating in Angel Sweet, but I've never seen it full. Get a punch card if you live in the area. If you like firemen, this would be a good place to see them hanging out.  =)"
1,"Been parking here at least 10 times; fast, affordable and safe.  Use your smartphone and YELP app to access the super check-in discount.

While it didn't happen this time, at Christmas they were especially full, so don't be surprised at that time of year and make reservations (yes, make reservations at a parking lot)"

Sit and try one of their gyros, hummus or the vegetarian combo! All tasty and well served. After that you can check and buy some interesting to impress your friends next time!"
1,"Ohhhh, I like, I like!

First of all, if you haven't seen Distrito, scope the photos on the website. High-five to the interior designer. From the gold glittery tables to the gumball wall, this place screams fun, energy, and overall a kick-ass atmosphere.

I stayed at the Saguaro for five nights, so I had plenty of time to get my dinner (and breakfast!) on at Distrito. Actually, for dinner, I had room service but Distrito is where it came from. I was absolutely starving after a long plane ride, so I ordered the chicken tacos, guac, and a plantain appetizer, and it only took about 20 minutes to show up. Win.

The chicken tacos were really, really good. Little corn tortillas, marinated chicken, slaw, radish, and a perfectly-sized slice of avocado. There were three of them and I could only eat two, but they were so well made. The plantain dish was also impressive, and had some black bean puree underneath that balanced out the sweetness of the plantains. The star of the show, however, was the guacamole. Tons of lime, zing, and flavor. I ate almost all of it and it was definitely worth it. Usually when I have guacamole it's just so-so and I have to add some spice, but this showed up completely perfect.

When I had breakfast, things were also on point. They made me an egg white omelet with tons of vegetables inside, and my co-workers seemed to love other menu items like the pancakes and french toast, as well. If I lived in Scottsdale I'd definitely visit this place a time or two more. Consider me a fan!"
1,"Followed a Dr. that I respect to this practice and I have to say I'm pretty impressed. As a long time multi-four-footed caregiver, I have seen more than my share of veterinary clinics and animal hospitals. I know the drill and have seen more than one vacation be sucked in to the great black hole of ""well of course I want  to have the best care"". 

The first thing I noticed is that there is NO odor. It doesn't smell like there have been decades of animals paraded through the doors that feel the need to pee as soon as they enter the room... just in case this is their one last shot at leaving something behind. 

Then there is the overall feel of the place. The office I used to frequent always had a frenetic sort of feel to it. Files were lost, techs were running, the waiting room was packed with stressed out clients, etc. This office was peaceful. Whether is natural or contrived, I could care less. My dog picked up on it immediately and her normal ""OMG what are we doing HERE?!!"" behavior was replaced with something I've never witnessed in a vet office before. She was calm! 

It's clean! Except for the area around me that was covered in the undercoat that Zoe was stress releasing, there were no traces of other animals. 

The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I had a HUGE file that I was bringing in and they patiently sorted through the entire thing. While I was there for one of my pets, the receptionist offered to set all of them in my household up for me with ""Client Files"" so that I wouldn't have to be bothered in the future. I thought that was a wonderful, time-saving offer and in the event that I ever have to go with an emergency and am not able to focus on paperwork. 

Finally, I was in an examination room at the time of my appointment and waited less than 3 minutes for both the tech and the Dr. I was in an out under 1 hour and that my friends is superior service IMHO. 

I look forward to a long relationship with Palm Glen and will happily drive the 5 mile difference from my old vet, in order to ensure both my pets and I are treated well!"
1,"I have never had a bad meal from here. I can't say the service is quite up to par considering the menu, interior and pricing, but sometimes the food is all you need to be won over. This restaurant is within walking distance from my work and when I have gone for lunch, I have never had to wait. The host is professional and poised. Unfortunately, the hostesses are not as much. But again, you can quickly look past that. The menu has already changed at least a couple of times which makes the dining even more fulfilling because you can keep trying new things! The food is definitely not average or casual cafe style, yet you can find things on the menu such as homemade chips, baked macaroni and cheese and a buffalo sloppy joe. The bar is beautiful and they have live jazz on Saturday nights.Great for a business lunch, a romantic dinner or tasteful happy hour."

Sound quality is great for the size. Glad they reopened one of my favorite venues. and YES everybody has gotten lost the first time they tried to find the Nile. The main & front room have shows as well."
1,I really like the facial I had done. I was able to choose what I wanted and I could see the results when I left. Very nice.
1,"Definitely going to make this a normal visit instead of waiting 3 years to try it.  Kool Aid in a Mason Jar was all I needed to see to know this was not going to be a typical dining experience and something to remember.  Food was amazing, the staff was friendly and the prices for the portions were more than fair.  Only the off beat location prevents me from making this a 5 star review."
1,"If you love BBQ, this place is for you.  

Nostalgic feel with a farm tactor sitting in the dining room.  Good selection of sides and the rootbeer is home made.  

Like Joe's Farm Grill, this place can draw a crowd and you'll be in for a long wait for service but timing is everything.

Can be a bit pricey is you load up but the quality of the food is top notch!

I'll definately be back."

1,"Chai is alive and well, and living at City Center at City North.

I had been dating a gal name Starbucks for the past few years. She was a plain gal, generic if you will.  She was dependable and available. I was feeling as if i needed more out of my relationship, as you can imagine. 
So, at times, I would cheat on my gal with another gal named Coffee Bean. Coffee Bean was Kosher and a bit edgier, yet had a leaner list of qualities. 

I needed more out of my relationships. They say that when you're not looking for someone new, they appear. Well, that was the case with my new crush named Press. 

I had been to High Street for dinner Kona Grill, yet most of the other shops and restaurants were closed or not yet open for business at the time. 

I ventured back during daytime hours to give them another opportunity.  I had heard about Press, so I was more than excited to give it a go. At this point I was still making caffeine a part of my diet, so i ordered something called a ""Dirty Chai."" This was a Chai with espresso shots. Press uses a powdered Chai which, in my opinion, works better than the liquid or tea bag forms. I was also given the option to have my frothy delight in a ceramic cup.  I opted for that.  I felt like i was having the type of coffee house experience I had only just imagined. 

Press occupies a well appointed space, too.  From the wood and granite, to the stained concrete floors, I felt as if i were in a European city, not a Phoenix strip mall. The free wi-fi is a major plus, in my opinion. 
Press goes as far as to have a ""dog friendly"" cart outside, in its ample outdoor seating area. 

I spoke with Steve, the owner of Press, at length.  In talking, I asked how Press came to be, and he said that his wife had wanted to open a coffee shop one day.  Well Steve, you have certainly exceeded her expectations, as well as the residents of the Greater Phoenix area. 

By the way, Press serves sandwiches and soups, as well as an extensive list of wines. 

Check it out, the staff will make you feel at home, or like you're on vacation in the cozy European city of your choice."
1,"I couldn't find anything to add to the previous review except I have never had a bad experience here no matter who did my nails. They are reasonably priced, friendly and one of the few nail salons I have been to that seem genuinely interested in the customer returning. The owners are friendly and the selection of acrylic colors offered is excellent. If your a magazine reader you might want to bring your own as they only have people and entertainment mags, however I've only had to wait once in nearly a year."
0,"Over-priced, over-salted and thoroughly unimaginative. Package those adjectives up in a pretty little nutshell and you've got Arcadia Tavern. Arcadia Tavern is a family-friendly, bland and inoffensive, if not overpriced, alternative to Applebee's or TGI Friday's. 

I was seriously enthused when a tavern opened up within a five minute walk of my house. I like drinking and I like walking. Combine the two and you get stumbling, which can also have its high points, ripped jeans notwithstanding. But Arcadia Tavern is no tavern. No self-respecting tavern can commit the cardinal sins of happy hour and retain their integrity.

Cardinal rule #1: Thou shalt not end happy hour before 7 pm. 

Seriously. What is it with places trying to redefine Happy Hour as the hours between 3 and 6 pm? I understand that from a price point perspective the 3-4 or 4-5 pm hours are much cheaper than extending food and drink discounts to the 6-7 pm crowd. But I consider that the same as shining up a turd and calling it a custom made gift. Ooo, you offer three hours of happiness? Pity I can only make 15 minutes of it. 

Bottom line is 5 pm's whistle blowing time, gridlock makes a girl crave a drink and 6-7 pm is the prime hour for getting that drink on. To end happy hour before 7pm pretty much guarantees happy hour barflies will not frequent the establishment.

Flipside: Three dollar Dos Equis, all day, every day. At least there's that.

Cardinal rule #2: Thou shalt offer more than frozen food and canned items as appetizers, and if offering cheap frozen crap, it shall be reflected in the price. 

Fries, tater tots, onion rings, wings, mozzarella sticks, chicken strips, and the ubiquitous spinach and artichoke dip? Whoa. Don't strain yourself, TGI Friday's. 

My main gripe is with the monster nachos. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills, but the chips, seasoned shredded chicken and nacho cheese were all wicked salty. We're talking mouth-puckering, tastebud-slaughtering salt laden nachos topped with canned pickled jalapenos (gross), black olives (more salt) and black beans (respect).  I'm also biased against the unnatural plastic consistency of nacho cheese. It makes everything soggy and is a tacky substitute for the real deal. Cheese should crisp up around the edges and pull apart in delectable strings, not ooze sadly over a mass of chips and overpower everything else on the plate. I will say that the guacamole and pico de gallo that topped the nachos were delicious, tasted homemade and were a saving grace, but they were also woefully underrepresented compared to the macnasty nacho sauce. 

Flipside: The three mini sliders (albeit meager) and grilled veggies platter with hummus showed promise. 

Cardinal rule #3: Thou shalt provide affordable drink and nosh.

So what's that nacho monstrosity going to run you? Twelve bucks. Don't blink. You read right. Twelve dollars for salty garbage. Mozzarella sticks? 7. Dozen wings? 9! Completely unrealistic. Shave a couple bucks off each appetizer and you're in the reasonable price zone, particularly considering the cheap tasting ingredients. Taking that first impression into account, I don't think I'm going to shell out 10-12 dollars for a hamburger (without fries) when I could go to Delux and have my socks blown off with flavor for cheaper or to the Chicago Hamburger Co. for pennies in comparison. 

Flipside: There is no positive here. For the caliber of food offered, the prices are completely unrealistic. Even the desserts are overpriced. Six bucks for a root beer float? That's a big middle finger right there.

Arcadia Tavern, as a representative of the Happy Hour enforcement squad, I hereby declare you undeserving of your title. Four Peaks is a tavern. The Vine is a tavern. Icehouse is a tavern. Hell, even Carlsbad Tavern does it better and they have plastic bats hanging from the ceiling. 

I regret that I shall never again spend a happy hour in your warm embrace. Although you may still win me over with $3 you-call-its on Thursday after 9 pm. Particularly when accompanied by a little goldfish racing. 

I totally hate goldfish, too. At least share that in common."
1,"Double-dog dare you to ask for a side of ranch.

You won't find a fryer in the house either. But what you will find is that every dish is under 475 calories - & every dish, delish!  Well, I'm generalizing because we DID only have two dishes, but if the chefs can make a salad taste THAT good, why, what will they be able to do with meat!? I'll find out sooner than later. 

We'd only stopped in for a mid-afternoon snack on a Wednesday - the decor reminds me a bit of ""Frank & Albert's"" - warm, clean lines and inviting. Our service was spot-on. Everyone was professional and friendly. Many yummy dishes on the menu - I wished I was hungrier! (The menu changes weekly, so I didn't get too attached to any one item!)  Mini, adorable desserts were tempting-looking and only $2.50 each. Seasons 52 also has an extensive wine list and a roomy bar area. There's even a piano behind the bar; I did not see a tv in the house. 

Let's see: No tv, no ranch. no fryer. Tasty low calories at reasonable prices, with great service in an upscale cozy setting. The place even made me abandon my ""butter mantra"" for a couple of hours. The reinvention of dining out!?"
1,Great hh prices. Like to go and unwind. Definetly give it a try
1,"Shopping around TMP made me thirsty for a cocktail.  There is some type of Cantina I passed by that did not look relaxing so I went to my Yelp app to see what else was around when I saw the Thirsty Lion.  I was expecting an English pub-like atmosphere and I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw the clean and modern decor.  I sat at the bar, a great thing about this place is that it has HH on the weekends!  The bartender wasn't that great.  He just threw down a drink coaster and walked off.... uh... really?  When he came back around I ordered a specialty drink - mint and cucumber cooler or something like that - I was hoping for more cucumber than mint but the mint was overwhelming, it tasted more like a mint julep.  They did have a great selection of beers on tap but I really wanted a cocktail so the next round was a jack and coke.  

I wasn't planning to eat but I noticed some hard-boiled eggs wrapped in sausage on the HH menu, I had to try those, it's not often that I see something unique on a menu.  They were pretty good actually.

I can't wait to come back."
0,Nice resort located in downtown Chandler. The rooms are spacious and fairly comfortable . Chill by the pool and sip on a margarita from the pool bar.

1,"Hiking Camelback Mountain has to have been the most difficult 1 1/2 mile hike (Just up, 3 miles total) that I have ever been on. While it is not a very far distance the increase in elevation is over 1000 feet in that short mile and a half. 

The first thing that I recommend is either getting to Echo Park at bright and early (between 4:30-5:30 am) or, if you come later as I did just parking in the overflow parking. You can find a simple map to the overflow parking at: 

http://phoenix.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Camelback-Mountain-Trailhead-Overflow-Parking.png

The walk to the Echo Canyon trail head to the overflow parking is only about 20-25 minutes and it is almost guaranteed to be faster than driving around looking for a parking spot somewhere else. 

The trail itself takes about 20 minutes to actually get difficult but when it does decide to start getting hard it does not let up for a moment. There are chain link fences at a couple of places in the hike to stop people from accidentally tumbling over very steep ledges and even handrails at times for more support up the trickiest sections of the hike. 

The good and bad of this hike is how crowded it is. There will rarely be a moment where you wont see someone coming or going for more that 50 yards at a time. This means that while there is little to no quiet and privacy, that if something were to happen to you there would be plenty of witnesses.

The rest at the top is wonderful. The view is by far the best in the valley and something that I recommend to everyone. Take 20 minutes or so to eat a snack, drink some water, take a breather and take some breathtaking pictures from the summit. The summit is usually pretty crowded so you won't want to stay too long. 

Be careful on the way back. It can be very tricky navigating some of the areas and twisted ankles and even broken legs are not terribly uncommon. Again, take you time and take plenty of breaks when you need them and you should be OK.

Don't forget to take plenty of water, I recommend at least a liter per person if you go in the morning and more that that if you do in when it is warmer outside."
0,"Not a big fan of the Boba Tea House by Lee Lee. I like their decor, very hip. However, their milk tea mix was not that great. It felt like basic sugared water. I've had better ones over in Lollicup or Quickly in LA. It's a pretty busy location as it is next to Lee Lee's, but unfortunately they definitely aren't quite there yet with the competition."
1,"Met a friend here for lunch & had a great experience. I've been meaning to get here for a while, having heard great things. Unfortunately didn't get to sample the wine menu. But the lunch offerings were good - turkey sandwich was very flavorful with its crumbled goat cheese, vinaigrette, and fig jam on 9-grain bread. Such a large sandwich runs the risk of being dry, but no problem here. My friend got to enjoy the sausage mac & cheese; I was tempted by some of the other versions on the menu - next time for sure. Also, the place wasn't too crowded for lunch - no problems getting a table or parking."
1,"I would never have picked a museum cafe for lunch, even though it is practically in my own backyard, but with my friend's endless ravings about their Dreamcatcher Salad, I relented.  And I'm glad I did!  It's now become a staple for lunch meetings!

The dining area is bright and cheerful, but the outdoor patio is truly a delight on a beautiful day!  It is serene and is surrounded by a plethora of desert plants and a lovely water feature.

The menu is rather short on items, but long on freshness and flavor.  Many of the offerings lean towards Southwestern style.  I have found my favorites on the menu, in particular, the Hummus Veggie Wrap which is filled to the brim in a healthy spinach tortilla with Tepary bean hummus, tomatoes, roasted red bell pepper, grilled red onions, pepitas, smoked gouda, and romaine.  (I've tried to duplicate this wrap at home with underwhelming success!)  Each sandwich comes with the choice of salad or chips. The portions are hearty.

The service is attentive, but not intrusive.

An absolutely divine dine!"
0,"Live entertainment, friendly, restroom clean, my dish was good, but my hubbies dish the meat was not seasoned at all and for a fajita they gave him a burrito flour size tortilla and took about 15 mins to bring a second one.  Plus hrs are posted wrong on yelp. States open from 6 am to 2 pm even though they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner."
0,"I liked them a lot until I had to call them to get the discount fare for the toddler but since I was booking our tickets together (because a two year old legally can't fly alone so I HAD to) on the phone, I wasn't getting the lower internet rate.  That's extortion!  I'd much rather do the entire thing on the internet.  Then he tells me that the child's fare goes off of the regular rate which is only one dollar less than the internet rate.  What the hell?  Why would I ever want to sit on hold for 25 minutes to book a flight to get this crap?  Then they tried to get me to pay $15 more for the next class up (I know, upper class on Southwest - strange).  I asked what I got:  1.25 times the miles (yeah, you heard right 25% more - that's going to get me far), first boarding and a free drink.  I clarified that with a child I get to board first anyway (they confirmed this).  Then I asked how much a drink costs.  $5.  So essentially they are asking me to pay $15 instead of $5 for a drink I may or may not want (then again, I'm traveling with a child so who am I kidding, I'm going to need a drink).  And to top it all off, they tell me we can't do on-line check in because Beckham doesn't have a picture ID.  I tell them but he does have a picture ID.  He has a passport, in fact he has two.  The Southwest person tells me no one has two passports so I tell him that no, it's true.  The toddler and I both have two as we have dual citizenship.  (Not that we would need them to fly to California so the whole conversation is entirely pointless now.)  The Southwest man being the all-knowing scholar he is tells me that's impossible and illegal.  I take a deep breathe, tell him he's right, I'm wrong, how stupid I am.  I must be thinking of my library card.    Why are things so difficult sometimes?"
0,"This place loses out due to poor customer service, which is a shame, because the food is good.  it didn't used to always be this way.  It used to be good food with a friendly, attentive staff, but then they changed management. 

Our first experience with the new management and staff wasn't great.  Service was slow, but we figured they must be busy so we let it slide.  Then we bought stuff from the market.  They have two registers side-by-side--one for the market purchases and one for the restaurant bills. We went to the restaurant register so we could pay for our market purchases along with our meal.  First of all, we got ignored and had several customers taken before us, despite the fact that we were there first.  When they finally decided to acknowledge us, they told us we couldn't pay at that register since we had a market purchase.  Rather than just sliding over to the next register and taking care of the purchase there, they made us wait in line again.  Finally we checked out...and were overcharged.  We didn't realize this until we got home and by then it wasn't worth going back. 

We decided to give them another chance and went back a few weeks later.  This time the service was even more slow. 15 minutes passed before we even got our water.  45 minutes later our food still hadn't arrived.  The waitress kept speeding by our table and ignoring us.  We snarfed our food down fast when it finally got there since we had to get back, and went to pay.  Long wait again as we got ignored for other customers who came after us, and then they overcharged us.  Again.  Fortunately we caught it this time.  They hastily made the correction, without so much as an apology.  Rather, they acted annoyed that we were holding them up.  How about getting it right the first time if you don't want to do it again? 

So that was it.  I don't think we'll be going back.  It's really a shame, because the food is  delicious and this used to be one of our favorite places.  It's just a shame that the new staff sucks.  I can get good food elsewhere and not be treated like garbage and overcharged."

Some frozen shrimp balls?  Win.

They're pan-asian everything.. and if they don't have it, you're hosed!  This is the only game in town."

1,"The view from the top is quite amazing! I took my fiancee up here for a sunrise as part of her proposal, and she loved it!! You really can see the whole valley. As you're driving around Phoenix and have an unobstructed view to the south, you should be able to see all of the radio antennas at the top. You'd be surprised how high you are when you finally up get there. The rangers up there are friendly too. Just as some of the other reviews state though, do WATCH OUT for random bike riders, runners, and various pedestrians on your way up and in. The roads are a little narrow and there is not much room for error."

 $12.95 for a sandwich, fries, and a dollop of soggy coleslaw ???

I kept hearing from my friend, his mom and the waitress that the sandys are HUGE.
nope.

Thought we might split one.
nope.

My sandwich was flavorless..err..thats a lie.. it tasted like stale bread.

$29.98 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas (its an effin sandwich!!!). I only had $40 (only ?)

0,"I don't usually review based on one visit.  But when the experience and food is as bad as this, I'll make an exception...

This place gets two stars for the multiple big screen TVs.  If you're here strictly to watch sports and have a beer or three,  you'll be fairly happy.  However, I came here for a bite to eat, and that's when there where I ran into problems.

The bartenders are a disgruntled lot.  Their sour mood when I sat down set the tone for my whole experience here.  They're not all bad.  One of the male bartenders actually smiled occasionally and chatted with some of  the customers.

The food.  How can you screw up cole slaw?  What more can I say? 

Beyond that, if you're in the area to watch a game, this isn't a bad choice.  Just swing by McDonald's or somewhere else for dinner."

0,"When I'm on vacation, I try to go to restaurants I try to avoid chains because what's the point?  I want to eat local eats.  As I walked in, I realized I've been to the one in Long Beach, CA though the menu was completely different. Or perhaps it was the late night menu but it was decidely more ""Southwestern.""  Ah well, it had been several years and it was quite late at night so it didn't matter at this point.

I ordered the green pork tostada which the waiter assured me was very small and the hot wings. The tostada was huge. What a liar (yes, I called him that to his face). 

I ate a couple of bites and finished the wings. I would have the tostada cold and congeal-y in the morning before flying out. Surprisingly, the flavors were locked in this way and acceptable as a 5-minute scarf fest. 

Oh, and my vodka tonic was very good.  Not bad and I kind of dug our picnic style bench high top table."
1,"Papago Park is a great place to ride (bicycles, that is).  The terrain can be as easy or as hard as you'd like-- just choose your trail!"
0,"First time ordering calamari salad...which had a strong onion (??) flavor and tasted weird...Being raised on Vietnamese food, the strangest of foods has been in my mouth, but I think this falls into the acquired taste category...As in I never acquired a taste for this.

Pad thai was okay...the noodles were a bit over seasoned. I felt like I should've eaten it with rice to tone down the flavor.

Papaya salad was good...still on the look out for that authentic not watered down version, though. Just like my friend's mom makes it! Yum!

Thai omelet. Good.

The people were really friendly as well, which helps, but you KNOW I'm all about the food.

I had takeout and the box for the calamari salad read: ""Carimali Salad"". :) I love it!"
1,"It smells yum. Just your basic Italian deli/sandwich decor.

They offer sandwich, pasta, pizza, salads, buffalo wings, beer, wine, tea, pop..

They have cold cuts to take home,  pre made pasta salad, mozzarella etc.

I ordered ham and cheese sandwich. The dressing is very good, meats an cheese was good and so was the veggie. It doesn't beat my favorite sandwich from olean NY at tops grocery. But it's def going to be a spot I'll be at."
1,I have been going to Salon Mila for 12 years.  I will never go anywhere else.  My hair always looks amazing when I leave.  The color and cut are always perfect!  I feel glamorous and beautiful when I leave.  First class salon!  Beautiful surroundings!  Always great service!  They aim to please!  Mila knows what it takes to make sure her customers feel welcome all the time!  Thanks everyone!
0,"I love Cheuvronts and have been going there regularly for years. Why only three stars then? Over the past year and a half the service has gone downhill. I find that the servers are impersonal and rigid, and sometimes a little pompous. After three or four bad experiences in a row I just don't go there anymore. They do have great cheese plates and a fantastic happy hour...just don't catch them when they have a special event going on."
1,"Gosh Darn It! They had to be good. I was hoping, since they are so close to my home  and right next to where I shop for groceries most often (Fresh & Easy), that they'd be horrible. Then I'd never have to go again... But, alas...too good to not go back, that's for sure!

I've said it before, I'll say it again: if you don't like a lot of frosting, just wipe off the portion you don't want. Heck, if you're sitting next to me and my kids, they'll eat it for you!!

I didn't think I was much of an frosting fan either so I wiped off most from the Chocolate Chip Caramel, only to find that the milk chocolate frosting covered with a caramel drizzle was UH-MAZING! Scraped that heap right back in my mouth where it belongs! Yum. Equally impressive it the dense, moist cake (as opposed to light and fluffy texture; these puppies are HEAVY). The White Chocolate Raspberry was chock-full of white chocolate chips and the frosting was not too sweet. It was the prettiest one as well, with white sprinkles and raspberry sauce drizzle. Thoroughly enjoyed the two other chocolate selections (Texas Milk Chocolate & Midnight Magic) as well--Yes! I had four, but only cut them in half so I could save the rest for (my husband) later.

Bonus points for presentation (the box is adorable) and variety."
1,We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club.  Everything was so tasty; juices are fresh-squeezed.  Menu has quite a variety and portions are very filling  It gets busy early.  Be sure to give it a try.
1,"OK, I went based on Tim C.'s Yelp review of this place, and I am so glad I did. I rode my bike up there around 1PM Wednesday afternoon, and I have to say I was not disappointed. 

Even though it was hot out, the outdoor table was surprisingly cool and comfortable. I got an iced soy latte and it was so good. I don't know how to explain it, but there is great tasting espresso and there is bland espresso. This place just has great tasting espresso. I found out while I was there that Ted (the guy who made it) had roasted the beans himself. You can buy the beans from them if you are one of those industrious people who grind and brew your own espresso drinks...I am not. I prefer to leave that to the professionals.  He actually ground the espresso when I ordered my drink. If you get the chance please go see what I am talking about. You will notice how much better the espresso is.

The place itself is so beautiful and relaxing. If you sit outside like I did, you are basically sitting in a big outdoor garden. It is kept cool by the overhead canopy and the swamp cooler air blowing out from inside the coffee shop. Ted was really friendly, I felt comfortable just hanging out for a while reading my book. Unfortunately, the coffee shop closes at 2 PM, otherwise I bet it would be beautiful at night. This place definitely looks like something that would be in a cool little town somewhere, and  not off of a busy street like Hayden Rd. 

Ted also told me he makes the lemonade himself fresh squeezed, something I love and will definitely try. When I go back, I think I will go a bit earlier.  I may do a bit of plant shopping as well while I am there...

Bottom line: Great atmosphere, drinks, and service!"
0,"Until they get their quality under control, we won't eat here except for lunch. We ate here last weekend and both had the roasted chicken. The problem was it tasted like it was basted in cinnamon and the sauce for the risotto had at least 10 whole peppercorns on each of our plates. I actually bit into to one before I realized that the sauce was just crawling with them. They could've strained them out, processed them in, whatever, just don't serve me a plate with a bunch of whole peppercorns. This tasted NOTHING like the previous visit when I ordered the same exact dish. When we finally let the management know that our food was unacceptable, he said the best he could do was a 20% discount. Well. we  weren't looking for a free or discounted meal, but rather some acknowledgement that they actually cared about the food. That never happened. Unless something changes, the burgers are decent and that is about it."
1,"This gym is great...  I joined because it opened only about 3 minutes away from my house.  I keep going back because every person who works there is so nice and greets you with a smile and a friendly hello.  It is not intimidating at all, which is a big step up from the LA Fitness that I used to go to.  The staff gets to know you by name and most of the other members are quite friendly as well.   The gym is open enough that you can do free weights on your own without bumping into anyone and there are always plenty of cardio machines available.   I've been going there for over a year and plan to continue doing so!"
0,"Bad music, slow service, disgusting overpriced drinks, and annoying patrons.  Definitely wouldn't come back if someone paid me to. I can't even drink this margarita."
0,"I was working in Phoenix and was told that I had to try Delux, as they had the best burger and sweet potato fries I would ever have.  The fries were pretty good, but I don't think they were anything above average.  The burger, though, I thought left a lot to be desired.  It was juicy, but I would actually call it more grease-laden than truly juicy.  I like a moist burger, but I don't want grease dripping off the bun.  That was my major problem.  That may be what some people like, but I didn't."
0,"New N. Scottsdale location, Baaaaaaad!  The were 10 staff members milling around and there was no manager on sight.  $10.00 for a mediocre burger, with an uncooked, tasteless bun not large enough to encompass all the arugula.  They forgot the sauce, which apparently is the main ingredient.  The upgrades are ridiculous.  $1.00 here for cheese on an already ""well priced"" burger (btw Flemings blue cheese/bacon burger $6, best in town), $5,00 here for fries.  C'mon.  And, it's the same two hispanic guys, who don't have any idea about chef inspired food, cooking in the kitchen as every other restaurant, there is no chef For the price, you want to see the chef/owner representing, especially at a new location, and, you want competent staff who treats you as #1, and not their conversing with the other staff members as #1, and you want to enjoy what is supposed to be one of the best burgers in town!  What a disappointment.  The lack of top down management care and supervision carries through in all elements of the poor experience.  Take a pass."
1,"This deli style restaurant has everything you want.  Good service, inviting atmosphere, super clean appearance and most of all freshly prepared food that is attractive and delicious!

I had the Salmon BLT.  I did not even have to ask the friendly order taker to make the bacon crisp or the salmon to be slightly charred.  Everything about this wonderful sandwhich was perfect.  To be honest, I would switch out the the shredded iceberg lettuce for spinach leaves.  Still the sandwhich was terrific with it's nice proportion and the aioli sauce to bring it all together.

My dining comanion had the spinach and sirloin salad which was also completely finished at the end of the meal.  By the looks of the empty bowl it came in- it must have been really good!

There are some other items on the menu I look forward to trying out next time, like the wood fired pizzas and the burgers.
Great location in the heart of old town Gilbert.  Galleries and other small businesses are in the same area.

A great find.  I will definitely go back!"
0,"After hearing for years that this is Theeee Best Breakfast in town I finally checked it out.  Now I've been twice, and I just don't get it.  I just found NOTHING special about this place at all.  It's a cute breakfast dinner and the pancakes and waffles are ... well, pancakes and waffles.

Both times I've been we had to wait to be seated, and both times I didn't feel it was worth it.

In my opinion Palette, Over Easy and Matt's Big Breakfast are so much better.  Of course your mileage may vary."
0,"I usually shop at this store because it is the most convenient and has the best prices and selection in the area. For staple goods such as bread, milk, eggs, meats, and canned goods, the prices are usually lower than the other large grocery stores. Their branded goods (Kroger) such as condiments are usually good quality compared to store brands at other stores. However, in the last few years, vegetable prices have skyrocketed (other than tomatoes, celery, and lettuce) so I find myself driving several miles away to a healthy food specialty store to stock up. This Fry's was recently renovated, seemingly to make it more difficult to find the items you are looking for, and making what should be a quick trip in an out into a half-hour ordeal. The aisles also seem to be harder to navigate, with bulky displays jutting out here and there, and it's difficult to get around other customers. What I do like is that there are four self-checkouts so you usually don't have to wait in lines. I also like Fry's policy of charging you the price on the shelf-tag, or you get the item free. I've often walked out with cash in my pockets when I went in with none. Sometimes due to the confusing ""VIP customer"" pricing on the receipt, it's a bit difficult to tell if you paid the right price. Read your receipt carefully!"
1,"Just had an early dinner with the kids tonight (kids eat free from 3-6pm btw).  I had the prime rib and my wife had the fish special, kids had the mac and cheese. All were great meals. The reason to go here is to sit on the patio, it's fantastic!  Not impressed that at 5:30pm I had to valet, when I'm with the family, I'd just rather park and walk (needed to walk off the prime rib and wine anyways!).  This place is not cheap, and with $18 glasses of wine, there is no happy hour at the restaurant!"
0,"basically, i'm only reviewing this store because i really do not care for the employees here. there are a few nice ones, but overall, they are either cranky, stressed out, or missing.

the redeeming points? a nice selection of crafting products. but then again, you can always just go to a DIFFERENT location. i'd opt for that."
1,"Brought my car here b/c of the reviews I read on yelp. My fan was running excessively. The mechanic came and looked at my car. The coolant was low. He grabbed a can and filled it up. No charge. I then told him I needed new struts. He quoted me a price that was cheaper than the one quoted to me in CO a few months ago. I honestly didn't shop around for a cheaper price here in Phoenix, which is unlike me. The reviews here, and fixing my fan problem at no charge had me sold. It seems so rare to find an honest mechanic now-a-days, especially in this economy.  Made an appt. Car was finished super quick, in the time frame that was promised. The mechanic went out of his way to show me the damage struts he replaced, then told me my new struts came with a lifetime warranty. Dang, did I time warp back into the 50s?  Hopefully I won't have a need to go back, but if I do, I'd gladly drive out of my way one hour round trip for their honesty again."
1,We purchased a Groupon deal and went and tried this restaurant . The food is excellent and the service is very good . If you are wanting real Texas BBQ then this is the place to go!
1,"We stayed at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak for four nights...ate here twice, and picked up food to go twice. Everything we had was tasty and well-done. I liked the New York Gorgonzola sandwich the best, as anything with creamy horseradish is spot on in my book. The au jus seemed better the first time I had it. We came back for s'mores with the kids one  night. We were kind of hoping to do the marshmallows over the fire pit outside but there were a few people who may have posted on here previously who looked at our kids in horror. The server rushed over and said they're not allowed to serve marshmallows over the fire pit -- they bring a small burner right to the table. We still had fun and the old fogies outside enjoyed their drinks in peace.

Oh - prices are a bit on the high side but that's to be expected, i guess, at a resort. Bottom line - the food was good!"
1,"Chance encounter on this little (well, maybe not soo little) gem of a place. Yelped it the moment I passed by it because of all the cars present in their parking lot. Although there are only 8 reviews for the place, what people had to say about it really made me want to visit. 

Was well greeted on a spontaneous adventure to the restaurant for dinner. The bar was packed so my party decided to get seated in the main dining area. Got seated right away and was introduced to our server in no time. Think she had to swallow a chill pill or something because it took some time for her to be nice (most likely the main reason im not giving this place 5 stars)

The menu was pretty reasonable. Starters dont exceed $10 and entrees range anywhere from $5-$15 (If Im correct, there is only one item on the menu costing $15) 

We started off with three appetizers, thinking it would be the only dishes ordered (little did we know):

- Grilled Spicy Chicken Wings: Some a little burnt but it tasted great. The portions are large and seasoning just right (or too bland depending on what you prefer). I liked that it was grilled, less of that greasy hell overwhelming the taste of the actual meat.

- Homemade lemon garlic Hummus with pita : sooo delicious. It was only about $6, it comes with a bunch of pita. My party of 4 shared it and still had left overs =] definitely recommended.

- Cheeseburger Sliders x3 on Egg Bun: The bun is delicious! and the meat is perfectly cooked (medium) and seasoned. The perfect balance of meat, bun, and cheese. Comes with diced pickles.

We were having a jolly time when all of a sudden someone notices a dish being served to the the table next to us. It looked so good, she decided to order it herself. We ended up sharing the Half Chicken entree and I was extremely impressed with how it came out.

The chicken is juicy and tender the entire way through. No parts of the chicken dry, every bite was well savored and just...mmm mmm mm
Came with two sides (we chose the green beans/onions and mashed potatoes): green beans weren't my favorite, they were overcooked but the mashed potatoes. Perfectly cooked, tasted so fresh. They don't use a ton of butter or sour cream which was favorable to my taste buds. 

Would definitely come again

FYI: 
happy hour 3-6:30 pm. From what I could make out on the menu written in chalk: Half off appetizers and three 5.5 oz of draft beer for $5 (normally $6 for 3 - 5 oz beer sampler) oh and something about $5 wine"
1,Every time I visit Arizona I love to eat here to food is vary good and I have my wife to thank for turning me on too this restaurant I wish they would have some in Georgia
1,"It's a beautiful hotel, most definitely. The recent renovations are gorgeous and simply wonderful. The grounds are lush and well manicured and the staff was polite, friendly, and very helpful. The rooms were pretty adorable  in terms of the architecture and surrounding areas. They are spacious and comfortable, but the bathrooms are VERY dated. As in, 1970's fantastic here! Funky beige tiles everywhere, dark dingy shower with frosted glass window that really doesn't let much light in. I know they're trying and they're so so close to being amazing in every respect, but the rooms could be improved upon.
The pool areas, common areas, poolside bar, and convention areas are gorgeous though!! You instantly feel right at home in these areas and it was beyond pleasurable just hanging out at the hotel! Really perfect for group gathering and family away-time. And did I mention everything is gorgeous?? Because it really is! 

Only other negative is that they charge a ridiculous amount for wifi, which is in ADDITION to the daily resort fee, and don't provide complimentary water bottles, which you would think would be a no brainer for a luxury resort in the middle of a desert state."
1,"When cowboys ride off into the sunset, they probably stop at Greasewood Flat for a burger and beer. This rustic little bar is located a bit outside the city right near Pinnacle Peak and is definitely worth the drive! You'll know you are in the right spot when you see the antique farm equipment and suddenly feel like you are walking up to an Old West saloon. Say hello to the mule on your way in. Outside they have picnic tables, horseshoes, and fire pits (gets chilly out there in the desert!), and on the weekends they have live music and dancing. 

Inside, the bar is pretty small, and the place is covered in dollar bills and business cards left by satisfied cowboys and cowgals. For the nights without live music, don't you fret, they have a jukebox with tons of country hits. The night we went it was the bartender's birthday, and the regulars were definitely having a good time.  

Both a historic landmark (120+-year old original stagecoach stop) and a dive bar, Greasewood Flat is clearly special to Arizona, and is a definite must see. I'll be going back on a weekend to get the true Greasewood Flat experience and hopefully see a cute cowboy or two.."
1,"Fabulous place.  The food is good and the selection of organic and specialty items is nice.  Love the butcher shop and Jerry the Cellarmaster is abslutely fantastic.  Seriously, if you want a bottle of wine - he is the best resource.  And if you go back frequently he tailors his suggestions to what you like.  My favorite thing about this store is that the staff tries so hard to treat you like a valuable customer.  They remember your name, ask after your kids and honestly act like they like you.  It feels like a small town grocery store and I love that.   Breakfast is fantastic and the coffee is great.  Everyone at the coffee counter is terrific.  This was a really great addition to the neighborhood."
1,"Ok so who goes from California to Scottsdale and ends up at a Sprinkles? That would be ME. 

In search for a cute independently owned cupcakery to test how AZ cupcakes stack up to SF Bay cuppies... we headed to downtown Scottsale. WELL, not really for the cupcakes, but just to check it out. However, seeing there were a handful of cupcakeries nearby, we had to try one.

BUT the reviews of 2 and 3 stars for some of these places seriously put me off. I hate dry cupcakes and I was not eager to spend precious calories on something that would not satisfy. Sprinkles had the better reviews and whala it was open after all the other places closed. (Note to self, who closes a bakery at 6pm? Cupcake freaks come out at NIGHT!)

We have a Sprinkles about a 15 min drive from us@home, but have I ever gone??? NO. So yes here we are at Sprinkles in AZ. The gals are friendly, they answer my questions tirelessly. I end up with 2, lemon and chocolate marshmallow.

They stay overnight in our hotel room since our dinner left absolutely no room for cupcakes. I was worried they'd be dry and stale the next morning when I busted them out at 7am before my workout. Gotta get some carbs in so I can burn them off right?

Bottom line... Sprinkles may not be a cute little indy shop any longer but their stuff is solid. No mixes, the dark chocolate cupcakes are the perfect combo of dark, bitter, and sweet. The lemon was dense, I think mine is better, but the chocolate marshmallow OMG. It was like a grownup version of a Hostess cupcake, MY FAVORITE. Despite their overnight rest, they were not dry, the result of a fair amount of oil if the residue on my fingers was any indication.

Please send me three dozen of the Chocolate Marshmallow please. I will love you forever. Thanks."

Don't get me wrong, I still love JFG; I just didn't care for its BBQ pulled pork sandwich and fries.  The coleslaw was good, but not so fantastic that it's worth the pain after.  I thought that the pork had too much of the cloyingly-sweet sauce.  Wasn't so sweet when paired w/ the garlic toast points.  However, if you look at the included photo, you'll see that the two pieces of bread were under the pork, and therefore completely saturated w/ sauce.  I like accompanying bread to be crispy/crusty (love that crunch!), so all I had to enjoy that afternoon w/ the pork was the part that stuck out from under all that sauced meat!  What a waste (tsk, tsk)!  The boat of fries was just a complete soggy mess.  I should've asked them to sub sweet potato fries instead, but why must I pay extra to get a perfectly crisped product?  Then again, one (wo)man's treasure is another (wo)man's trash, and vice-versa, eh?

Today wasn't a great day for me w/ regards to Mr. Johnston's two restaurants (see my ""recent"" Coffee Shop review).  I hope my next visit to a Johnston concept yields a happier adventure!"
0,"I called The Town Dump to ask if I could come in this week and interview them for an English paper about a small local business, and the owner was just incredibly rude. She didn't even let me finish telling her it would take five minutes of her time, preferring to interject and tell me to go somewhere else. When I explained that I've heard wonderful things about their business from friends, and that that sparked my interest, she said, ""Well, go somewhere else.""
I've never even been inside, and I sure as hell won't go now. Maybe it's just me, but I don't like shopkeepers who snarl at their customers."
0,"I always said that my last meal on earth would consist of the AZ88 Chicken Sandwich and a dirty martini.  That was until I went there again the other night after a couple year hiatus.  The magic, was gone.  I was so disappointed and sad that it wasn't as memorable as I previously remember.  I will go back and try something else because I didn't have a bad experience and never have.

I recently sat at the bar and had 2 different bartenders.  Both were great and entertaining.  And, it doesn't help that they poured a strong and delicious drink.  Get a martini!!"
1,"Luckily, I didn't have to travel far to make my connecting flight. And for this, I thank you, Phoenix.

0,"Meh.  Met up with a few friends here and sat on the patio on a Saturday night around 8.  There are no heaters, which would be ok if it was a nice fall day or a summer night, but i was a bit cold towards the end.  There is indoor seating as well so this shouldn't be a deal breaker.  I ordered a few nice glasses of red, one pinot noir and one petite syrah.  I ordered the tuna salad and the bf ordered the grilled cheese.  It was just ok, and so was the service.  Our plates sat on the table for over 20 minutes after we were finished before they were cleared. Cute place, good music, not a huge variety on the menu, just salads and sandwiches.  I would likely go to humble pie next door next time while in the area which is how we spotted The Main Ingredient in the first place!"
1,"This place gets it right from the moment you walk in the door. Signed baseballs jerseys and bats by legends on the wall, a friendly host to greet you and when you sit down they ask if you want free chopped liver. It comes with bits of egg and onion, warm rye bread and bagel chips. 

Our waiter, Jeff, was friendly and attentive, even lending us his flashlight to read an old newspaper story in the rafters. The cream of mushroom soup made from scratch was superb. Our mains were baby back ribs, the specialty of the house, cooked perfectly with a flavorful sauce. The 'broasted' chicken was to die for: moist and juicy with a crispy outer skin. The fries were piping hot, as they should be. And the portions are beyond generous.

We topped it off with key lime pie, light and tasty, an ideal complement to the meaty mains. And the bill was under $60, an amazing deal. As a bonus, some of the players drop in during spring training."
1,"Best and most helpful hardware store I have visited. Thank God I live almost across the street!

After many, many home projects and recently rebuilding my kitchen, I have frequented this Ace almost more times than I should. But I am always pleased at how quickly and smoothly my searches at this Ace are.

Try it, you'll like it!"
1,"People that are rating this place low are nuts.

It's a greasy spoon sure, and yes, sometimes as you'd expect from such the service leaves something to be desired.  That being said this is a super tasty burger.  Very moist and delicious.  The beer is also cheap and they have a great selection of local brews on tap and in bottle.  The beer on tap comes in one size, FISHBOWL!

Also, get a fried egg on your burger, trust me, you owe it to yourself."
1,Love this studio! Teachers are nice and accomodating. This is possibly one of the best yoga classes I have studied.

0,"""Honey I Shrunk the Lunch Specials and the Restaurant, too!"" is more apropos of a name for Thai Basil. Now don't get me wrong, I like Thai Basil.  The food is decent and the interior is nice, but the tables/diners seem to be squished elbow-to-elbow New York style. Spartan, but slightly upscale, this restaurant ALWAYS seems to have a wait.  

The yellow curry here is my favorite with a delicious balance of coconut, spice, carrots chicken and potatoes.  I can't ever seem to get enough, and I really mean that.  The portions here are small, and while lunch portions are expectedly small, portions elsewhere (at Chanpen Thai, for example) are larger and less expensive. Elsewhere the Thai BBQ chicken comes with 1/2 a chicken, but at Thai Basil they give you three lonely strips like cheapos!  The massaman curry and pad thai are pretty good too, but I feel they're just OK.  I've had better.

Service is hit or miss here.  One thing that's consistent: they always seem to be understaffed. Once when I was dining alone (at a 4-person table) they had the nerve to ask me to move while in the middle of eating, to a 2-person table. 

To me, Thai Basil is style over substance.  Not impressed.  Next."
1,"In Phoenix on Spring break vacation, we found Baby Kay's by using the entertainment coupon book we bought to use while out there. They were in the front for fine dining, and had a great coupon deal, along with a sample menu. Everything on the sample menu sounded delish, and we very much like the spice of Cajun cooking. It was a little hard to find, although we were not at all familiar with the area. We had the wings as an app. and used the Louisiana gold hot sauce, something new to us that we are having trouble finding in Ohio since we fell in love with it there. The gumbo was outstanding, and even the alfredo pasta had a spice sprinkled on top for a Cajun style kick... it was unexpected, and awesome! Huge portions - that we both had plenty to take with us for a whole other left over meal. ... the prices were great, especially with the coupon (or actually the entertainment card that they punch for fine dining restaurants). Excellent staff- close to closing for the night, and welcomed us in, and didn't rush us at all - made sure we were happy with everything we ordered, very friendly! Definitely would recommend it for any one who likes a little Cajun kick, and something different from chain restaurants..."
1,"Dim lighting. Fleet Foxes. Beautiful upstairs seating that almost seems secret. Band of Horses. Benches that are less cushy than you anticipate them to be. The Shins. Black board specials, just because they look cool. Beirut. $13 vegetable dishes. 

Intimidated yet? Fight through the angst. Once you take your first bite of food, all the hullabaloo will be well worth it.

Order the forbidden rice bowl. Tell them to make it vegan (the vegetables are usually cooked in a bit of butter)... after all, you're a pseudo-hipster for the evening, and it's fantastic. If you're depressed by the idea of black rice as your main carbohydrate, the flat breads are taste-gasmic. That crust... the things I'd do for unlimited amounts of that flat bread crust. Top it off with figs and ricotta, and there's no way I'm passing up a square or two... or seven. If you're still not sold on the idea of carb-loading, the salmon ""superfood"" is delicious and nutritious, and who's not into a little super(food)iority now and then?

But on to the main event... the chocolate stout cake + spiced ice cream + espresso ganache was the best chocolate cake I've ever had. It was just so damn... moist. There, I said it. Moist. Moist. Moist. Ew. But really, yum. If caffeine, chocolate and alcohol don't suit your fancy (wimp), the cheesecake in a jar was equally delightful. Cookie crust + strawberry compote + cream + cheesecake. Layered. In a jar. Who thought of that? Someone with adorable thoughts, that's who. 

And let's be honest, you've earned dessert. I mean... you ordered a healthy, vegan entree over the french onion cheeseburger, right? Right. Of course you did."
1,Mojo made me fall in love with fro yo. I love Mojo's Twitter Tuesdays where you can get half off of your fro yo. The location is awesome; I can go to Mojo between classes. It's here where I found my love of the pomegranate & acai flavors as well. They have awesome seasonal flavors as well as the other usual staples. I love their different toppings and it's a good place to hang out with friends and get your Mojo on :)
1,"I think there food is amazing!  However, it is a bit pricey which limits my trips there.  I love the white decor but hate how expensive the drinks are!  I ordered a Key Lime Martini and it was 15.00 for one and served in a tiny little glass!  Come on!

Additionally, last time I was there we went to the bar afterwards and most people were wearing flip flops which drives me nuts!  Take a shower, get dressed, put some effort in!  Save the flops for the pub!  Hopefully, it was just an off night because I really think it is a cool spot!"

0,Made me and my bro sick. Tasted good at first but something wasn't right.
1,"I have been living in Arizona for 4 years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich, until now.  I even gave the same statement to the owner.  I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out, and while I was waiting, I let him know my frustrations.  He gave me his card and told me to call him after I ate the sandwich because he wanted to know what I thought.  Well, it was FANTASTIC!  Of course, I called him back to let him know.  

The service, and the time and effort put into the food cannot be beat.  This is what you get for a mom and pops type place.  

There are plenty of other sandwiches and foods there too.  I can't wait to go back and try some more!"
1,"This review is for Gil's catering - which is fantastic.  

Our perfect event for a new product launch needed to be casual, but tasty and high quality.  Gil's was all of these things.  The food presentation is pretty without pretension.  Everything was fantastic.  Best of all, Gil worked with us to plan an event within our budget.  

Fare is traditional with a tasty twist - our group loved the chimis, taquitos, enchiladas and especially the chips.  

We expected 2 servers and 4 showed up - including Gil.  They over delivered in every sense."
1,"Always love the ALofts
If you've stayed at one, they're pretty much the same
Rooms were clean and comfortable.
There was plenty of room in the standard king room
Bathroom was nice, you don't have to deal with the miniature shampoos, they're in the wall mounted containers, which is nice.
Only thing missing is an iron and ironing board, but other than that, the room was perfect, especially if you like hip, modern decor, which I do.  Rooms are a notch above TheStandard in LA, but not quite as roomy.  The rest of the property was just OK, yes, they have a lounge, but need a restaurant.  This location also does not have a DJ as some of the other ALofts do.
All in all though, probably one of the best hotels to stay in while in the Phoenix area, especially for the price.  I heard from the bartender that the one in Tempe is more live than this one."
1,Amazing thrift store! The owner was extremely kind and polite to me so I'm not too sure why one reviewer was saying he was rude. They had baskets of clothes out front that were free for homeless or needy people which I thought was great considering places like goodwill often overcharge for clothing that should be donated to those in need. Great find on a Robert cavalli jacket and J.crew pants that were literally like new. Prices were completely reasonable for quality second hand clothing. For sure will go back!!!
0,"Meaty, beaty, big and bouncy!

Add ""beefy"" and you've pretty much summed up your 5GB&F  experience!

After detoxing this morning, I was really hungry...after all, I'm a pretty big and bouncy boy and when you lug this kind of tonnage up and down the canal, you're going to need some retoxing!

And since it's Taco Tuesday, I thought a burger fest sounded about right!

I needed to be up north anyway, so I texted my order (what a time and vexation saver that is!...two stars for 5GB&F right there) and it was ready, hot and juicy when I rolled in.

The burgers and fries remind me of nothing so much as Wendy's of about 30 years ago...you know, when Wendy's was actually pretty good (not like now when, they consistently screw up your order and figuratively, literally throw your bag-o-food into your car as you idle by the pickup window).

The burgers are OK, the fries are fresh and peanutty (no, really...fresh peanut oil...the fries taste peanutty!), and the Coke is, well, Cokey. 

The atmosphere is nice enough, all red and white checked and tons of ""look at me"" crap on the walls (""Best Fries in Hoboken!"")

The music was also reasonably pleasant (Men at Work...""I come from a land down under""...I shuddered a little bit at the part ""and men chunder""...please, no chundering while I'm eating!).

Anyway...

I was able to purchase this little repast for a mere $11.83 (I saved a little by having the small fries).

I know, Grind or Delux prices for a retro Wendy's burger!

I'm no spendthrift, but I could feed a family of 6 at In-n-Out for $12...and with better burgers.

But, 5GB&F filled me up, they had my burger ready to roll and they very nicely didn't mess up my order (but then again, how could they screw it up...they were ordered to prepare my burger by a computer...we know what happens when you don't do what a computer tells you...you ""accidentally"" ride over a cliff on your Segway, that's what happens!)

 And, in a nostalgic sort of way, they reminded me of how Wendy's used to be (complete with 70's music), and for that, a reasonable 3.25 stars."
1,"This is  the best Asian restaurant in town! Previously Shanghai Palace, this out of the way restaurant serves up some of the best curry and pad Thai, that I have ever tasted in my life! The Panang Curry is so savory and aromatic, literally one of the best things I have ever had. I honestly crave this dish about twice a week.
Also any thing on the menu can be made vegetarian this is a huge bonus for all veggie's around town!
 The Chef-owner Tottie Kaya, is always very hospitable. She walks around to each table making sure everything is up to standard. I have never once had a bad experience at this delicious eatery. So if you love Asian cuisine, you must dine at Tottie's!"
1,"I came in for a gift for my boyfriend's pleasure.  The lady working there answered my questions thoroughly and professionally.  Any shyness or awkwardness I might have felt disappeared.  I was prepared to spend more for a different product but was steered to a better choice by this lady.  Turns out, my boyfriend was very happy with his gift.  This was around Halloween so there were a lot more items than usual like costumes, pasties... fun things.  I can wholeheartedly recommend this Fascinations!"
1,"LOVE Oregano's! They have delicious pizza, pasta, salads, wings, everything. The portions are huge and the prices are right and I can honestly say I've never not left Oregano's full and satisfied! Plus the atmosphere is fun as well. If you've saved room after your meal, try the pizookie, it's amazing. Giving 4 stars because there is always a huge wait and they don't take reservations or seat you until everyone is there, and also because the deep dish pizza was far too cheesy and saucy when I tried it (more than a deep dish should be) but everything else is superb."
0,"I am a sucker for a theme restaurant. I have been wanting to visit this place for a while because of their whole gimmick. When you arrive a nurse checks you in, gives you a hospital wrist band, and dresses you in a hospital gown. Seriously, I love a gimmick more than the next person but the Heart Attack Grill is 100% gimmick and only 60% good food. The menu consists of burgers which vary only in the number of patties, french fries fried in lard, shakes, pure sugar coke, and PBR. They have a strict no sharing policy which completely bummed us out because we wanted to order the huge 20 patty burger and split it 3 ways. We ordered 2 single bypass burgers (one of our trio boycotted the burger because of the no sharing policy,) all you can eat lard fries, a vanilla shake, full sugar coke and a PBR. The burgers were ordinary, the fries were ordinary, and the service (aside from being dressed as naughty nurses) was ordinary. The only win was the delicious butterfat filled vanilla shake. 

The bill came to around $30, which is a bit pricey because remember only two of us actually had food. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. It is a gimmick. Heart attack, fat, lard, waitresses dressed as nurses, cook dressed as doctors, sugar, beer...whatever. It gets old pretty fast."
1,"Be sure to save up for the $3000 coffee machine they demo'd for me! Nuts! I could never imagine paying as much for a coffee machine as I would for a used car!

I am really wanting to take one of the cooking classes they offer here. Soon maybe... Hoping for a Sur Le Table Groupon!"
1,"Okay before I get into the drinks, I'll start with the food.  My fave is the peppered turkey avocado sandwich, with these delicious fries.  

Or, (Amber: note the paragraph change) you could get the chili verde appetizer, or the grilled shrimp and guac tostada bites, or the tejas trio with guac, queso, and salsa and chips.  

Bottom line is the food is solid, all the way up to the fruit cobbler for dessert.  Settle for nothing less. 

For drinks, Z caps you at 3 margaritas so make it count with the chambord rita before you switch to beers.  It's good, you'll be flavored, life is perfect."
1,"Full disclosure: one way or another, I have only been to Roaring Fork for the Happy Hour, but the happy hour is darn good. You can, and you should, get that kettle of green chili pork or the big-ass burger, or better yet, share the two with someone nice. The huckleberry margarita is so good, I've had three in one sitting (no, I wasn't driving!). I fully intend to get over there for dinner soon, because I keep seeing the sugar cured duck on the menu and just thinking about it right now my mouth is watering. It gets pretty busy during the happy hour, though, so be prepared to wait a little if your party is large."
1,"I had to do some painting and needed help locating items and suggestions from the staff and boy were they ever helpful.  Nothing like Home Depot, where you have to go and hunt down an employee and when you do they can't wait to get back to their break or whatever was more important than their customer.  I was just overwhelmed by the courteous and quick service I received at this location.  Even their quality of garden plants surpassed several other super stores."
1,"They have the friendliest staff at this Whole Foods. They know me by name and always have samples ready for the little boy I nanny before we even walk up to the Deli counter. Maureen the checker, Kathy in vitamins, and Daniel & Paula in the Deli are all exceptional- go see them if you need anything they will be happy to help."
0,"If I could there would be two reviews here. The golf course its self would be an easy 4 star based on price and condition. Customer service would be a 1 star. 

Don't bother trying to be friendly with the pro shop staff, these folks are just going to through the motions of taking your money and doing the least possible to get their paycheck. But since the golf is such a great value and people will continue to flock to this place in droves I don't see them needing to hire people with personalities any time in the near future. 

The front 9 cart girl is friendly as is the lady working the snack shack on the back. 

Another thing that didn't impress me was being a walk on, renting a cart and being told that they already had 2 carts in that group. I am used to being able to have my own cart instead of riding with a person I don' t know and being subjected to their cart skills or lack there of. Turned out okay but just struck me as odd. 

I will continue to go back for the great value but I hate to reward bad behavior."

1,"Lolo's is one of my favorite places to eat in the valley.  Their dining room is very small and sometimes there's a long wait at the door but their staff is always super friendly and there for you if you need anything.

Things I've tried there:

LoLo's special which is 3 piece of chicken with 2 waffles, Stupid fries, side of potatoes smothered, Chyna's honey hots (which are their hotwings), Ivan's chorizo and eggs, and their banana cream pudding.

Their chicken is perfectly cooked.  Nice, crunchy, juicy, and very flavorful.  Their waffles are fantastic as well, but my all time favorite has got to be their Stupid Fries.  It's a basket of freshly cooked french fries smothered in gravy with bits of bell peppers, onions, and chunks of their fried chicken.  I have no idea how they do it but even though their fries are smothered, it stays extra crispy under all that sauce.  That's what makes it so darn delicious.  It's definitely a meal in itself.  Their banana cream pudding is so large you guys can share it.  Banana cream anything is one of my favorites so of course I would say that it was amazing!!

Their koolaide are awesome as well.  You can't come here and not have their koolaide.  I love their blue but I sometime switch it up to red.  My fiance and I have tried their Scottsdale location as well but I feel that the cook at the Phoenix location (which is the original) has got it down packed.  My food always arrive and taste just as good as the last time as to their Scottsdale location, the food doesn't taste the same to me.  Maybe I'm just trippin' but that's how I feel.  

Overall, this place is pretty awesome.  I can't wait for them to finish their expansion."
1,"I wanted to check this place out as I had got my mother in law a gift certificate for here...  It is what appears to be an old farmhouse that was left standing in the middle of Scottsdale busy city life..  The inside is very charming, like stepping into someone's home with all the good smells of cooking.  We didn't make reservations and since it was a Sunday, knew we were pushing it, especially with the after church crowds.  But as luck should have it, was able to sit outdoors and was such a nice sunny day, was great.   I had the Chicken, wild mushroom and leeks crepe..was that ever heavenly!  My husband the strawberry chicken salad, which he also enjoyed..  One thing that drew my attention was that there were a lot of women senior citizens...very well dressed ones...obviously part of the Scottsdale upper crust..I think we were the youngest ones in there.. Next time I'm back in Scottsdale will have to go back.."
1,"Love fondue? If so you've probably already tried one Melting Pot or another. I've been to my share, but this was my first time to this one just tonight. They've only been open two weeks - and they are off to a GOOD start! We had great service - very helpful and attentive, but not up in your face and of course, I love the food. Yeah, so it is obviously a chain and some people don't like it for that reason, but I think as far as chains go they do a nice job and the food and presentation is quality.

Sure, it isn't cheap...but it's not that kind of place. It's the kind of place you go when you are not in a rush and expect to pay more for the whole experience. It's a good place to go and linger over the food and conversation. 

We usually get : cheese - tonight we tried the special one, but I typically recommend the Wisconsin Trio, house salads or whatever the special salad is, the vegetarian entree, the extra veggies they give you and a dessert - tonight we did the S'mores. 

It was all tasty as usual, the service was really excellent and the atmosphere at this location is nice and quiet. It's in a random little strip mall-like place so not too many people know about it yet."
1,"So, for my date tonight to the Compass Room, I needed to get my nails done.  I removed my acrylics myself last week.  
I read the reviews here and decided to try DV.
You know, sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time, it's almost like the Soup Nazi.  Not this place!
There were two girls ahead of me, so I waited a bit, but only about ten minutes.  
It's bigger than the place I had been going to!  Really clean and I heard ENGLISH being spoken by the nail techs!  That was nice.  Yeah, there were still speaking Vietnamese (or so I think) to each other, yes, probably about us gringas, but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations.
I had Le.  She was so sweet!  I told her all about my date, too.
She was quick, and made some suggestions about what to get.  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.  I was kinda short on time, so I went with her suggestion of white tips.  Plus, it was about $5 cheaper.
She was quick but *really* methodical.  
I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics I've gotten out here in the PHX!
She even called me by name throughout the conversation.
$25 for a new full set.  Not bad at all"
1,"It's been a while since I was in Arizona, but I still remember the Olive and Ivy.  I was in Phoenix on a business trip and went out for dinner at this place with a bunch of work people based on a recommendation from a local.  We were not disappointed.  Firstly I want to say that the decor and outdoor area in this place is just fabulous.  We sat outside and enjoyed a delicious meal.  The staff were professional, welcoming and accommodating.  I enjoyed the experience so much that I brought the gf along for dinner when she arrived that weekend.  Both times I was extremely pleased with the food, drink, level of service and the ambience of the place.  5-stars for mine."

0,"I give this location no love.  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.  
When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously.

Don't bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.  

And for the sake of all that is holy - STOP WITH THE CRAZY I'M-TOO-SEXY-FOR-MYSELF SCENE!  YOU'RE NOT THAT COOL!"
1,"This place is a good go to when you're looking for a mexican infused panda express.  Haha.  Yum!  I got the combo meal with the Jade Red chicken made into a quesadilla and the diablo chicken.  Really good!  I also got jerk fried rice.  The beans were also very good.  Yummy in my tummy.  I really enjoyed Chino Bandido's, but don't think I could go more than once during a trip to Phoenix (I'd get very large from eating like this!).  :D  Oh yeah, if you want something more than a snack, don't just get a quesadilla by itself.  My poor brother thought the quesadilla would be huge and good enough for his dinner (thinking taqueria size), but it was pretty sad and small.  Luckily, my combo wasn't that small and I had extra food to share."
1,"I heart Rome's Pizza!! Being a native New Yorker, I have struggled over the past two years to find anything remotely close to NY style pizza. I had tried many local, independent places, but no one got it right. 


When I moved back to Scottsdale about 6 months ago my guy and I passed this place driving down McDowell road. I figured we could try it out (I'm always on the look out for some yummy pizza). Don't be taken back by the empty parking lot and shabby exterior, after all, isn't it what's inside that counts?? 


The food is always fresh. The Greek salad is great - it comes in small and large. The pizza is amazing (as long as you know what you're getting - NY style). I know that it's family owned, which I always have an appreciation for. 


The man that owns it does most of the deliveries. When I first moved to the area I called for delivery and he had to call me because he couldn't find my street. Embarrassingly, I only knew the street I lived on and not much more, so I couldn't help him. He told me that it was okay and eventually found the house. 
I expected him to get out of the car and give me a huge attitude, thinking I'm an idiot because I didn't know where I lived (could you really blame him?). But he was as sweet as could be and told me it was no problem. How refreshing! 

In a nutshell, hoooorray for Rome's!!"
1,"This place is a nice little change-up from the usual mall/Target/splash pad destinations that summer requires.  We have an 18 month old son that loves the noodle forest and the tricycle area.  The place has so much going on it is easy to focus on different things even if we go once per week.  The price is high if you don't get a membership, it pays for itself just in summer visits and then the rest of the time is icing on top.  I admit to enjoying climbing around in the big maze in the center of the museum, that made me feel like a kid again."
1,"An industrial-chic bungalow built just inside of the Coronado Historic District that showcases a loved downtown in an urban setting. The art and people are always beautiful.

0,"I just had a pretty unfortunate experience at Bison Witches in Tempe.  I remember liking this place when I went to ASU but not anymore!  It literally (no exaggeration) took 1.5 hours for our lunch, which was 3 people eating soups and sandwiches.  Our order took 45 minutes to arrive at our table (again, soup and sandwiches!), and several tables around us that had come in AFTER us, got food before us.  I normally am pretty easy going about stuff like this, but the server and a guy that appeared to be a manager/owner didn't even acknowledge the long wait time, no apology, nothing.  They weren't even that busy!  Our server barely even spoke to us when she came to the table, and acted like we were inconveniencing her.  I also saw her roll her eyes at another one of her tables as they got up to leave.  What kind of service is that!?  I wish I could say the food was any saving grace, but it wasn't.  Mediocre soup in a bread bowl, less than mediocre turkey on a bland sandwich.  I will NOT be going back, there's no point!  Save your time and money and hit up another one of the tasty places on Mill Ave.  Trust me, you'll be better off!"
1,There is something for everyone on the menu. It's more than pizza. The service is great. Get a table on the terrace and you get the view of the park and fountain. I will keep going back.
0,"Two and a half stars, really. 

This place is really quite strange. Video coffee bar? I don't have much to compare it to, I guess.

We'll start with the coffee: traditional espresso macchiato. No microfoam, large bubbles in the milk, too hot to drink right away. The shot was good, but by the time it was cool enough to drink had lost quite a bit of flavor.

Very friendly service, on the other hand. Given that Phoenix-foam tends to be subpar, I tend to think that service and atmosphere are almost more viable measures for successful coffeeshops than coffee. (in Phoenix) 

The actual place was pretty odd. Large paintings of Mexican sugar skulls in the back, nice chairs and tables, an orange faux-finish on the walls... And then the video bar element. Three huge flatscreens on the wall playing pop music videos from the '90s. Very strange, in my opinion. I'm not sure that Cher and Madonna really mesh with coffee shop, but I guess they're trying something new. 

I had a nice time lounging and it was relatively quiet with regularly good lighting."
1,One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix.  I love it.
0,"Last night on my way home from work I figured I would pick up some dinner for me and my wife who is taking care of our newborn all day and has little time to cook for us. I ordered chicken limone the menu says serves two to three and we don't eat a lot so I figured it would fill us up. The price was 18.99 but I figured in a family style Italian place and we should have plenty of food. 

I was handed my bag and I was sure it was the wrong order because it was so light so I checked it in the car and was shocked. 

I see three small pieces of chicken in a big container with a small piece of bread and that's it! 

So I figured they just forgot the pasta and went back in and asked the hostess and she said yes it comes with it then said no after thinking about it. 

So how can they justify that price? It was so small there was no way it would feed 2 people so I had to cook pasta at home and then reheat our chicken in the microwave.

I worked in the service industry for years and this place is a joke! 

FYI just because there's people with money who live near your restaurant doesn't mean you can tailor your food prices to their income level without delivering value.........if you sell crap in the worst neighborhood that same crap should be priced the same in a affluent neighborhood....same crap different place.

No value means lost customers ...."
1,"The naming of Asian themed restaurants is in need of a serious makeover. I think this is the next frontier for marketing gurus; a potential fortune could be made here. Most restaurants fall into the category of being painfully bland (""China Food""), vaguely insulting ethnic caricatures (""Mr. Yings' Happy China Meal"") or horrific puns (""Pho Sure""). Names like these don't inspire a lot of confidence in the quality of their food, even though that's not always the case (for example, ""China Food"" was actually pretty good).

So when I saw Thai Elephant, my mind immediately reversed the name which sounds suspiciously close to a parasitic disease (elephantiasis). Plus the fact that it's located in a strip mall is a bit of a red flag. But a growling stomach can overcome these biases and so I pulled into the lot......

......And was pleasantly surprised. This is actually pretty good Thai food. The inside is a little more ornate than you would have expected; there's the whitewashed walls that fits the strip mall theme, but the furniture is darker wood with slightly dimmed background lighting. A large screen TV was playing the Suns game in the back room and a small bar is present in the front part of the restaurant. There are a few tables as well as some seats with a mix of wooden booths and chairs.

Still wary, I ordered the hot tea, Thai sweet potatoes and chicken Pad Thai. All of these were above average: the Thai sweet potatoes were perfectly fried and mixed well with the slightly tangy sauce. I may have eaten more than ten times my body weight in Chicken Pad Thai over the years, and this was definitely above average. 

Although I was just here for dinner, I did see that they have a Happy Hour which runs from 5-7 pm. 

All in all, it's a pleasant place that belies its' strip mall exterior and is worth a visit for respectable Thai food."
1,"Ok so there are plenty of great reviews of this place already but I'm going to throw mine into the mix as well. 

The food here is fantastic, but if you've ever walked in there around lunch time you could probably figure that out from the crowd. Everytime I come in I try a new one and I'm always happy with it, I've yet to come across a pasty I didn't like here.

When it comes out you might not think it's that much - but portions are deceiving because the food's pretty heavy. My main tip to you is only eat half and then pause to let it sink in - take a break to drink your beer or something. I always force myself to save the second half and it makes me much less sleepy when I head back to work after lunch :) Plus it makes great leftovers."

1,"I absolutely HATE chain restaurants!

Although in this case, I have to make an exception.  I'm really into the food at Buca.

I used to live in the SF Bay Area, and I had to wait damn near 2 hours to eat at the Buca located at downtown SF.  I now live in Chandler, AZ and the first time I visited a Buca here, I didn't have to wait any longer than 30 seconds.  

I usually have a standard list of items that I order for the entire table when my family goes to Buca:

Bruschetta
Linguine Frutti DiMare
Margherita Pizza
Pepperoni Pizza
Chicken Marsala

I also frequent other independently owned Italian restaurants, but Buca holds a special place in my heart, and my stomach.  They have a signature flavor to their dishes.

1,"I am one step closer to completing my goal.  I want to visit every Grimaldis in the US before I die.  After tonights visit to this one, I have most of AZ taken care of.

We decided to come here because we had never been to this one.  We arrived and were seated right away.  Surprisingly this one wasn't crowded at all and that was fine by us.  

We got a small caesar salad, a small pepperoni and garlic, and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers.  A few minutes later we got our salad.  It was really good.  Just enough dressing, lots of cheese and croutons.  It was a good starter.  A few minutes after that, our pizza came out.  If you have read my other reviews, you will know that I think Grimaldis is the best.....this pizza was no different.  I really liked the white with roasted red peppers.  Everything was delicious and even though there was some doubt we could finish off 2 pizzas, I turned on my inner fat boy, and finished off all the pizza.  It was tough, but someone had to do it....little kids are starving in Africa somewhere....lll be damned if I'm going to waste some slices of this amazing pizza.  Down the hatch it went....my stomach doesn't like me right now because its so full, but he will forgive me once he doesn't get any of this delicatessen back in San Diego LOL."

The masseuse was knowledgeable and hyper receptive to my needs. I walked in trapped in a bubble of negativity. When I left I was literally floating... I felt cleansed and utterly flawless. Another major plus was that the entire indulgent, spirit lifting experience was under $40. A professional, extraordinary 90 minute massage for under $40?! Seriously go for it!"
1,"Yup, I'm reviewing a gas station. I like the Quiktrip chain in general and this station in particular.

I find Quiktrips to generally be the cheapest gas in town. Sure, the Arco sign down the street might say it's 2 cents/gallon cheaper, but then you get whacked with the ATM surcharge, not to mention there's all those bums loitering in the adjacent bus stop.

With Quiktrip, the place is well lit, there's always a trash can and window squeegee at every pump, the convenience store is better than most, and unlike most other gas stations, they don't charge you for the air compressor. Oh, and the person at the register will actually greet you when you step inside the door, while managing to sound sincere about it. Is that the coolest thing for a convenience store or what? 

Bonus: for those of you who enjoy shopping at the Hot Chick Safeway down the street, this is the Hot Chick Gas Station."
1,"I was not in a hurry to visit Humble Pie due to the mediocre reviews here.  The hubs and I eventually decided to stop in for dinner after a friend recommended it and I'm so glad we did.  

The vibe at Humble Pie on 7th is definitely good, perhaps due to its proximity to the alterna/artsy Coronado hood.  Relaxed, cool people, good atmosphere and tasty food.  We decided on drinks (a beer for the hubs and some tasty tempranillo for me) and ordered a large salad and a pizza to split.  Our server was great, always making sure our glasses were full and we were happy.  The salad was tasty and our arugula pizza was so good.  Who knew arugula on pizza would be so yummy?  While I was a tad disappointed when I didn't find something super chocolatey on the menu for dessert, the apple crisp topped with vanilla ice cream was delicious.   

We've since been back for drinks and pizza at the bar.  The bar tender was very attentive and friendly and the brick oven pizza was delish.  

Humble Pie a nice place to relax and unwind with good drinks and food."
0,"Cracker's & Company has always been a favorite breakfast destination. The food is always delicious and the selection more unique than other restaurants. My husband and I came in for a quiet Anniversary breakfast and although the place wasn't terribly crowded, we were seated right next to a table of ill mannered children and their mothers. I would have asked to move but our waitress was missing in action from the start of our visit. Before our waitress went MIA we ordered our drinks and entrees. In the past I have been given a small carafe of coffee but was only given a cup today which was disappointing. I ordered a carrot cake muffin when I ordered my entree and asked to have it served right away with my coffee. I also asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side of my ""New Princess"" omelet but it was spread over the top when it was delivered to my table along with my muffin. So much for enjoying my muffin with my one cup of coffee.  However, the food was wonderful as usual. The service was horrible and the ambiance was equally as poor. I'd hate to see a wonderful restaurant such as Crackers lose their edge in this competitive food service industry. I'm hoping today was a fluke and the service will improve to its previous caliber."

0,"I'm usually a big fan of dive bars but wasn't impressed, at all.  One of the kegs was empty so my friends didn't get their ""favorite"" beer, not a huge deal but not a good thing for 5pm on a Friday.  The servers seemed really overwhelmed and was probably due to the fact that there were only 4 for the entire place and it was really busy.

On a very positive note, my friends said that the food was really good for bar food.

This might be a great place for any day and time other than happy hour on a Friday."
0,"I have been to Las Glorias twice with people from work.  Both times I was underwhelmed.  The first time I went the service was good.  They were great about bringing out chips with salsa and bean dip and refilling drinks.  The second time I came the service was horrible.  We were there for over 1.5 hours because we had to wait for EVERYTHING and it was not very busy.  I was not impressed with the food.  They seem to put raw onions in everything, including the cheese enchiladas.  I really dislike raw onions and am a pro at finding dishes without them, but you cannot escape them here.  The rice and beans were good, but I cannot say much else for a positive about this place.  I will not be back!"

1,"Chakra has a very cute little cafe which I really enjoyed my first time there.  The day before, I had a steak for dinner..shhhh..however, really wanted a veggie filled meal for lunch.  I ordered the Pesto Basil Focaccia (tomatos, olives, peppers, feta) with a mixed green salad with a zesty lemon dressing. I loved it.  Lots of flavor and the bread itself was moist and light with a crispy bottom.  Cost was somewhat high I thought ($15) when ordering, yet it was really good and what I wanted so I was ok with the price . It did take awhile for it to come out, however, I wasn't in a hurry though.  The tea of the day was a strawberry green tea.  Very good, light on the strawberry so it didn't taste like a juice.  I did purchase some Vanilla rooibos tea and a cherry black tea.  Only complaint and being a Tea Snob with over 3 years working in the Tea industry and 80 hours of training, the teas should be in air tight light tight containers; keeping the air out keeps the teas fresh (green teas will go badly quickly!)  Chakra staff was very helpful and friendly.  I will go back to purchase herbs and teas in the future."

0,"This place was just okay.  While I can't claim to be an expert in Korean food, I am used to the Korean bbq restaurants in Los Angeles and I can say that this place cannot compete with those restaurants.  

First, they didn't seem to have the proper ventilation for Korean BBQ.  I have never been to a place where you could see smoke throughout the restaurant from people cooking at their table.  Second, the service was AWFUL.  It took them forever to just greet us and bring us water and the fact that it was toooo HOT in there did not make us happy to wait 15 minutes for our water or for someone to even acknowledge our presence.  

The food was decent but the seafood pancake was super disappointing.  They didn't even chop up the green onions that they put in it (seriously, like entire stalks of green onion) and it had no seasoning...  I may give this place another shot but as for now, I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could."

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=iKBiwthdGtENIqWfGK1V1A

The Chicken Skewers are very tasty.  The Teriyaki Sauce they are glazed are sweet and have the right amount of ""sour"" kick to it to balance the flavor.  The Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus is awesome...the Filet is tender and juicy and the Asparagus compliments it well.  Of course, the Chocolate Cake dessert is a nice ending for the meal.

The service can be a bit slow at times, depends on the server.  Generally speaking, it's pretty good considering how busy they are.

The people watching here is pretty good...watching all of the hipsters is hilarious.

1,This is a very interesting place.  Don't go here thinking it will be classy.
1,"First read about this in the recent 2009 Best of Phoenix and wow, what a great choice! The place is cozy and friendly (laidback atmosphere) with food that is a wonderful culinary experience. I enjoyed the roasted garlic in olive oil with the toasted baguette slices from the start menu, though the nosh plate might need some work (more types of cured meats, and maybe some of those tiny dill pickles). 

From the starter plates we had the crostini duo and the roasted grapes and brie on the multi-grain bread slices was popular with all - the one with the cucumber slices on them, a distant and less exciting second. The other starter - dates stuffed with homemade Chorizo and grueyer cheese, yum! The come on a bed of greens with some sort of vinegar dressing, which was a nice compliment.

For Sharing Section of the menu - the citrus brined fried chicken and cheddar cheese waffles, loved by all! I recommend ordering it early since we asked for it about 7 pm and it was the last one left. Even the braised greens were good. I was not so impressed with the halibut filet plate  - nicely seasoned but frankly, a bit dry.

Other thoughts - they really like cucumber here - they put it in the water (makes it quite refreshing), garnished my gin and tonic with it (homemade tonic, nice but not really wowed by it), and had it on the previously mentioned crostini duo plate - just seemed like a lot of cucumer. As for the service, it was good throughout the meal. The waiter kept things well paced and was a good source of information when asked, without being overly obtrusive.

If you haven't gone, worth checking out and if you have gone worth going back again. :-)"
1,"Went today for the first time. The quesadillas were the best I've ever had. My husband had the Cuban sandwich, which of course I tried...it was equally delicious! The atmosphere made me feel like I was back in the Bahamas. And not to forget the staff. We sat at the bar, and the bartenders were wonderful and so nice!"
0,"I have been a ""regular"" customer at this salon ever since it opened.  At first it was great!  Clean, relaxing, and welcoming.   After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week.  I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure.  She paid attention to detail and didn't rush through the whole process.  I didn't have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day.  I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday ... 

The guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb.  I didn't notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off, revealing it.  Tracy was doing someone else's nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail.  It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it.    I was shocked that she didn't tell him to at least put his gloves back on.  The ""massage"" that he gave me was hardly any massage at all.  He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv.  Definitely not worth the $25.   The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail.  The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I don't get an infection.  This was by far the worst pedicure that I have ever received. Even though I had a great gel manicure here, my last experience was so horrible that I will not be back."
1,"Thanks for helping me to find Valley Eyecare Center, fellow Yelpers!  I visited their office as a new patient and knew from the moment I walked in that it was going to be a positive experience.  The receptionist was  friendly, the office was modern and clean, and the wait was super-short (~3 mins). I was impressed with care that was provided and didn't feel rushed when working with Dr. Eric Clyde or his assistant.  The three words that come to mind when thinking of this office are: professional, prompt, and accurate.  My visit was for a contact lens fitting, so no comment on their frame selection / service."
1,"The new store is smaller than the previous one. But it's still a reliable digging source for records. I wish there was a better selection of dance tracks, but that isn't really their thing. They did have the new Chromatics and Glass Candy 12"" singles when I was in there last, which was nice.

Great selection of hip hop vinyl, some awesome indie records, etc. Definitely recommend this if you're in the Tempe area."

Typical bar food with no particular edge to make it memorable. 

The staff is very friendly and the service is very good. 

Just average, not memorable."
0,I didn't try any food hear but this place seems like it has a split personality. Tons of tvs showing sports so sports bar. At the same time there's a dj blasting club music. There weren't that many people dancing. We went here because the place next door had a huge line. One plus is that theres a second bar near the patio that we stuck by. This place to me was...meh.
0,"Stopped in Sunday for lunch after a high recommendation from a friend of mine in San Diego.   She claimed it was the best sub she's ever had so I had to try it.  Unfortunately my sub came up short with lack of taste and toppings.  When we pulled up I noticed it was super busy and was thinking man they must have great subs for it to be so packed.  Was lucky to get a booth inside but it wasn't as clean as others have stated in other reviews.  I had to take one of their comment cards and wipe the table of all crumbs on the ground as others had obviously done from the looks of the floor.  I had the Chipotle Cheese Steak sub that I split with my husband.  The bread tasted ok, but it wasn't fresh out of the oven. They skimpt on the steak and hardly saw any onions at all on it.  For the price of the sandwich I really was expecting to get more.  The sauce was the best thing about it but I was wanting more of it as well.  I won't be going back.  Sad that it wasn't a better first impression."
1,"I love this place!  it's a cultural experience!  I think even if you are Mexican, this place delights all the senses!

I love the tortilla department!  36 freshly made yellow corn tortillas for $2.50!!! 

the ladies at the meat dept were fantastic!

The wall of spices, herbs, and chilis was incredible.

I did not have enough time to sit and eat there but that's the plan for the next trip.

I came home and made shredded beef tacos with all the fixings.

My rec is come and linger and enjoy the sights and then have a great lunch either at the food court or at the restaurant next door."
1,"Mole sauce was amazing! Chicken was a little dry, but searously the mole sauce was good enough to eat with a spoon.
Skip the fundido.  The waiter could not explain some of the items on the menu, which was funny. The hicima tostado was great!  so was the mango crab salad."
1,"I was in Vietnam last May, and spent every summer in Westminster CA growing up, so to qualify my 5 stars, ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!""  I say to what's available of what I've seen in PHX area.  With that said, I've had the Bun Bo Hue, Pho Tai, Com Tam Dac Biet, Bun bi cha gio, and agree with what everyone said about cleanliness, freshness of condiments, integrity of broth ( lack of oiliness ), and general flavor.  The only thing that didn't rock my world was the bahn mi sandwiches- can't vouch for the assorted outsourced items in the chilled section either.  Besides that, If you want Viet food this is your place for the PHX metro area."

1,"I had the chicken teriyaki bowl (with extra veggies and easy on the brown rice) and it was a nice lunch.  Nice alternative to fast food, although those sauces don't exactly make it healthy."
1,"I visited this location a few months ago for the first time, and returned for my second visit the very next day. 
I got their standard chicken and waffle plate on my first visit, and just chicken and macaroni the next day.
Both visits were pleasant and the food was delicious.
My only criticism is that the waffles I got were a bit on the thin side. I've had chicken and waffles from many different soul food places all over the US and in comparison LoLo's waffles were just okay. The chicken on the other hand was A+. It was tender and juicy and well fried.
I see myself coming back here again."
1,Great place to grab some quick mexifood. Service at this location has been great. Fast and efficent. Try the pick two for a healthier smaller portions!
0,"I am not the biggest fan of fast food ever. But I really like Five Guys and this location is superb! 

They have really yummy fries and they give you so many! Like your bag overflows with the greasy buggers. Say what? Yeah they are really greasy. But good!

The burgers are really quite the bang for your buck too! Not the best burgers in the world but it is fast food not gourmet burgers. Be considerate for what you are eating and enjoy it for what it is. 

The pop machines are radical. You can pretty much have flavoured any beverage you like. 

The staff here is really friendly and that is a plus anywhere you go!"
1,"Always good beer and good food. Well let me say the food is not super fantastic but it's better than a lot of brewery food out there. Spinach dip is good, nachos are always a staple, burgers could use a re-do. Salads are pretty good, pizza is mediocre. Wings are not half bad!! Sauce is pretty fiery! Nice!! Not a wussy sauce here! But I do love this place and the patio. Beers you can't go wrong with. Very flavorful good beers. All I ask is just a bit more quality in the food. Thats all thats wrong IMO or not really wrong but something they could improve on."
1,"I can't say enough good things about this place.  I literally have never had a plate here I didn't like, they also have a interesting and ever changing list of specials (I usually order off the specials menu).  This is definitely one of those places I could eat at every day.  All that and I don't even drink beer, my friends really like the beer here though."
0,"I'm sitting here as I write this.I'm thoroughly unimpressed. 

With its bare white walls and sparse attempts at decor, this place is overly and unreasonably obnoxious. Despite not being crowded, and there never being more than one person in front of me each time, I had to wait on line.  With two people working behind the counter there's no reason to forget my order or make me wait 5+ minutes each time I needed something (to get my coffee, to ask for the Internet password, and then to remind them that I ordered coffee). Unfortunately the coffee supplied was  mediocre as best. Disruptive music selection that was too damn loud. Annoying..thank God for pandora.com, a good set of ear-bud, and reasonable wi-fi or I never would have gotten any work done.

The only reason I'd come back here is if my son had another concert to attend nearby. Needless to say, I do not recommend."
1,"This is really worth taking the time to see and experience.  The cost is very low - $5 per adult.  The garden is beautiful and peaceful with many areas where you can sit by yourself and reflect or just people-watch.  Also, the lady in the gift shop is very helpful if you are a first time visitor.

Metro Light Rail stop at Roosevelt and Central."
0,"I am glad that I remembered this place for brunch this past Saturday because it was good food and I love the atmosphere in the area as well.  I went with my BF and we put our name in, got some coffee and was seated quicker than the time the originally gave us, which is great in my book.  

I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo.  I wasnt a fan of it, it was good but not GREAT.  The chorizo really lacked flavor and punch...maybe I am use to the chorizo I get back home.  My bf had pancakes with ice cream on top of it and it looked amazing and he loved it.

I would come back and probably will to try some of there other things.  This is not a place to go to thinking you will get in and out quick, there are almost always people waiting but the walk around Old Town Scottsdale is worth it."
1,"I really like this place... they have great wine... try the tasting... it is 10 bucks and you get 5 tastes... they make almost all of the wine in house (i know the almond champagne is not made there)... i have not found any wine that i don't like... my favorite is their porto and chocolate port.

the other thing you can do is have a bottling party.  i recently purchased 30 bottles (at a great price!!!  cheaper then the wine stores).  they make the batch for you and then you have a party to bottle and label it.  this is a great and fun different party for you are your friends.  

despite it location it is a great place for a date..."
1,"Suffered a senior moment today! Did the yelp check and thought this sounds good...the drive was very dejavu and then I discovered why....see previous review! lol .....but to update....the volcano appetizer, sedona roll and Mochi Icecream (which I am becoming addicted to) were all wonderful. Our waitress was also fantastic bringing plenty of their delicious iced tea and keeping the ginger bowl full....a necessity for me. The place was full tonight and I can see why. Question is will I remember?"
1,"Treated some clients to Sweet Pea Bakery items and they loved them!  I got the PB & J cookies , Mojito cookies and Rum macaroons.  Love that they are not the run of the mill flavors.

The shop is adorable, it's actually really big-- surprisingly big!  The employees are really nice and personable and that is always helpful and welcoming, especially when trying something/some place new. 

They even gave me a precious thank you card to put with the cookies.  


I will definitely be going back for more!"
1,Wow. Best breakfast I had on my recent trip to Scottsdale. Ordered the eggs benedict with a side of corned beef hash. Waitress sweet talked the cook into making a side order since they typically don't do side dishes. That sweet little angel of a waitress made my day! Best corned beef hash EVER! Have I mentioned how awesome the waitresses were? And damn pretty as well. Double score.
1,"Fantastic Happy Hour 3-6pm! Half price appetizers and good drink prices. I like their Sushi and Garlic Noodles.

And pretty much everything I've had there is good. I had a Peppercorn Steak about 2 weeks ago and it was amazing. It's right next to the movies so it's a good place to meetup too."
0,"Not bad food, combined with so so service. I tried the firebird chicken pasta and i have had better at chilies. I also don't drink soda so i ordered a lemonaid and since it was made at the bar  (non-alcoholic) they were 4 bucks each. it sounds like im cheap but 4 dollars for some sugar, water, and lemon? then 4 dollars for a second one? ok. the place was nice and huge on the inside, if i was taking a client out i would go there for the appearance but for my son, wife, and myself i think next time ill pass."
0,"The ""chicken burger"" with jerk sauce was gross. It was dried out with terrible flavor. The only saving grace was that it was small, which says enough right there. As another reviewed said, it was a ground chicken patty when I was expecting a grilled chicken breast after going to places like Johnny Rockets where I believe they have a similarly named section of the menu that refers to chicken breast sandwiches. I realize I have myself to blame on that misunderstanding, but it was still a terrible sandwich."
0,"I really like this concept for a quick breakfast/brunch spot, but the execution wasn't too delicious. If you know me well enough, you'll know my first thought when we walked in was ""is there booze???"" The answer is yes. I recall seeing your typical breakfast bevies such as mimosas, bellinis, bloody mary's, etc.

So you go in, scope out the menu, order at the counter, and they bring you your meal and beverages. I ordered a simple eggs, potatoes, toast and sausage breakfast, and my friend had an omelette. We had just had brunch at Maizie's the day prior and our first impression was disappointment in the portions of the food, considering the prices were also comparable. Oddly, my sausage, potatoes and sunny side eggs had the same consistency, so that was off for me. They were all a bit soft and soggy. We, of course, enjoyed the mimosa and bellini, but $5 each is a bit high considering they're $3 @ at other places, and Cafe Boa down the block offers unlimited mimosas for a fixed fee with food. 

I thought the location was great, and the Sunday brunch crowd was nice. I'm not sure what it will be like when the students come back, but I don't think I would be back to find out."
1,"WOW!!! practically half price on everything compared to the chain stores.  Staff is always very friendly and helpful, and i've literally saved hundreds of dollars since I discovered this store just under a year ago!"
0,"Slices or Spinato's? When you're near Tempe Marketplace and don't want to miss the movie you are about to watch you should check this place out. Slices is more of a ""New York"" style pizza where as Spinato's is more of a homemade style pizza, and I don't say that with any disrespect. In fact, if I had to suggest one of the two places I would most definitely suggest Spinato's. I'll try outline my reasoning behind this choice.

Slices just has their ""NY"" style pizza, and to be quite honest they don't even do it that well. There are tons of places in Phoenix that do ""NY"" style pizza, and a notable place is Venezia's on Southern and Mill, not too far from Tempe Marketplace. Spinato's does have an ""NY"" style pizza and a Sicilian pizza, and the latter is actually pretty good.

On a Friday night, this place gets somewhat packed for dine-in, but you can order ""eat-in"". So basically, you order you food, wait to be seated, and then shortly after being seated you can get your food. This worked out pretty well. The service is also good, and the staff are pretty friendly. Bathroom was small, one bathroom for the whole place, but it was clean and well kept. 

The pizza was very interesting, we got a Sicilian ""Traditional Vegetarian"" pizza. Essentially, if you could compare it to another pizza it'd be DiGiorno. Seriously though, the pizza reminded me a lot of DiGiorno's frozen pizza. This place has a unique homemade feeling to it, and even the pizza. I'm not saying its bad, its just unique. The crust is actually delicious, and I usually don't care too much about the taste of the crust, but this one actually tasted pretty good. The downside though is the way they served it, nothing to pick up slices with, and it was super easy for toppings to slide through the grill when it was warm. It became somewhat of a pain to handle the first few slices. 

This place has serious selection issues. Let's see, pork, pork, more pork, and a little bit more pork, oh and a little bit of vegetarian stuff. Ok, so where does that leave kosher meat eaters? Not at this place. If you eat kosher meat, and enjoy it on your pizza, this is not the place to come. There is literally no chicken or beef available here in terms of toppings.

This place is pretty good and moderately priced. My significant other and I shared a 14"" sicilian, and got waters which totaled to something like $15. Certainly not a terrible price, but for the price I think we could do a little better. I suppose if we wanna catch a movie after dinner we would visit this place, but it is certainly isn't on the top of our pizza visiting list. Its good pizza, it filled me up, it was tasty, but pizza is a competitive market."

0,"The food at Beaver Choice Scandinavian Bistro is delicious; a little unusual, but easily understood. Hearty and reasonably priced. You can find out all about it at azcentral.com in an article by Howard Seftel. Then, after reading this survival guide, you should go and try it.

     Things you will need:
 1. An afternoon or evening with no commitments other than your meal. This could take a long, long time.
 2. A pen and a piece of paper on which to write your order (along with an alternate choice).
 3. Dining companions who all enjoy the same foods and are willing to eat off the same plate.
 4. A snack to tide you over until your food arrives.
 5. A sense of humor (but try not to laugh out loud),

     Here's our experience:

     Four of us entered the small, 20 seat restaurant at 12:10. There were six other people seated at the minimalist glass top tables. A large, and very appetizing looking catering order was taking up another table. We were given menus and told to order at the counter. There were many, many choices of entrees (a few warned that they would take between 20 and 35 minutes to prepare - we avoided those), and each one came with a choice of four side dishes. You can see why a paper and pen might come in handy. Ken went to place our order, but he had to wait for three other people who had arrived before him. It took a while.  Then he was told that my entree choice was not available because they had run out of gravlax. I came up with another selection, and Ken went back to the counter - where another group of people had taken his place and were ordering. Another wait, then my second choice wasn't available either. The sauce had to be reduced and wouldn't be ready until Tuesday. I figured I'd be safe with a third choice of Swedish meatballs, so I yelled over to Ken who saw that each of our orders was being written on a separate piece of paper. Odd.

     We settled in to wait for our food. Our drinks were brought to the table. Sena's eyes popped when she sipped the pitch black coffee. The waitress said it was always that strong and that there was no milk or half and half available, but she could bring out some heavy cream. I noticed that food was coming out of the kitchen painfully slowly. One dish to one table, a while later, one dish to a different table. Companions were left twiddling their thumbs. It so reminded me of Hell's Kitchen - I could hear Gordon Ramsey going ballistic: ""Shut it down you &*#$%!!!!"" . At about 1 PM my Swedish Meatballs were delivered. I put the plate in the middle of the table and invited everybody to dig in. Luckily the servings are large. We finished that off and waited another ten minutes before Sena's chicken schnitzel arrived. That too was shared. At about 1:35 Ken's entree was brought. That left Leon, who had ordered Tilapia. We flagged down the owner and told her that we had a 2 PM engagement and would like our remaining dish. She said she'd look into it, went into the kitchen and was not seen again. A while later another staff member came over and told us that there had been a large catering order, that they had only a six burner stove  and that 2 employees had called in sick. I mentioned that I didn't think it was right to serve some people at a table and not others. ""This is the way we do it, we're not going to change it, and Howard Seftel thought it was all right"", was the emphatic reply. More waiting. At 1:50 a different staff member came over and said it would be a few more minutes. To our disconcerted rumblings he said - and you're not going to believe this - ""The fish has to be defrosted slowly because of the parasites....""  At this point, I'll confess, I started to laugh loudly and somewhat
hysterically. It may have been rude, but I couldn't help myself. 

     We were out of time, so Leon decided he'd take the fish to go. Ken went up to the counter and gave one of my Valley Vittles cards to the ""parasite"" staff member, saying that the food was great but the service terrible. At which point the staff member had a melt-down, yelled at Ken to get out of his restaurant, then went slamming through the kitchen kicking something on the way out. 

     This was truly one of the oddest dining experiences I've ever had. Very Alice in Wonderland. But if you go equipped with the five items mentioned above, you'll have some excellent food."
1,"Loving this neighborhood froyo joint.  The topping selections are interesting and slightly different thatn some other places.  They have these yummy little chocolate rocks...kinda like candy coated chocolate shaped like rocks.  They were fun and tasty.  A nice assortment of topping sauces too...peanut butter, mallow, strawberry.  This place gets jam packed but they do have a good amount of seating both inside and out."
1,Like earning cheaper gas
1,"The best Chinese restaurant in the east valley in all categories from Dium Sum to banquet style dinning. Their steamed fresh fish with ginger scallion is my favorite. I have been coming to this restaurant for 5 years and never had a bad meal. recently, they even invented some new dishes for the weekend luncheon carts.Tthe stir fired radish cake with bean spout is delicious!"
1,"Great place!  I love that they feature wines from ""the little guys.""  You won't find most of what they feature at any Total Wine or Bevmo.  Small business supporting small business... totally awesome in my eyes!  The staff is knowledgeable and ooooh Chef Sarah - your food pairings with the wine in the wine 101 course were AMAZING!  Katie, the sommelier, is fun and she knows her stuff, plus it is clear that she loves to share her knowledge of wine with everyone.  I'll be back for sure!"
0,"Way over priced.  They replaced the valve below my toilet, the float in the tank and the small water line going from the toilet to the new valve.  It took them less than 30 minutes and my bill was just over $400.  I priced all the parts at a plumbing shop and it came out to $35,  and thats my retail price!!  They also charged me $69 just to show up at my house.  The plumber was knowledgeable I will give them that and if you really want to use these guys try and get a quote over the phone first."
1,"Sharp looking place modern meets old dinner, good food nice and simple breakfast menu. Staff could have been more friendly, but over all solid place will be back again!"
1,"Inexpensive, tasty, fast. The gentle peanut dressing on the pre-meal salad gets you started on a simple, no-frills meal with exactly one option from all of the classic dishes you expect at a Thai restaurant in America: massaman, red, green, yellow, or panang curry; pad thai or chowmein; meat or vegetable rice plates. There's nothing extravagant in spices or food choices, but you can order the spiciness level to you liking."
1,What a place for brunch. $4 drinks are fantastic. Their tenderloin egg Benedict and sea food sandwich is heavenly. Wish we had such a place in Los Angeles.
1,"Everyone point and laugh at the nerd reviewing a convenience store.

Oh yeah? Stuff it. Like donuts? Check this out.

Get in your car and drive here around 3AM and try their donuts. Had every single donut place in the area, and nothing can hold a candle to the QT donuts. 

My guy begrudgingly takes me here every couple of weeks for the donut stake out. It's so worth it. 

They get hard during the day, so seriously - 3AM or bust."
1,"Great sliders, come on all you can eat night!  Bakery is awesome, ribs are ok, free breakfast on your bday!  No clue how adam richman did the slider challenge, I wanted to cry after 10."
1,"I start at 40th st and Shea and I love this hike! This hike is HARD. I call it a sleeper hike, it starts off easy and then before you know it...BAM....it get's a little ridiculous. It will kick your butt but it's totally worth it."
1,"This is the best Seafood restaurant I have ever eaten in. I have to say it is not my kind of place. Very Scottsdale. But Man they know how to cook. I had a Special Shrimp dish of the night that was much better than expected and a very nice portion. The Calamari was 1000 times better than any other I have had. I am not a big fan usually, but this was different. It was not fried but pan cooked and even people that didn't like Seafood tried it and loved it. The Wedge Salad was good. We shared the Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes and Peas. I felt the sides were the only things that could stand some improvement. I had one of the tasty Mojitos and some Yummy Creme Brulee for desert. I am super glad this place is far away because I would want to go all the time. It is a bit pricy, but I felt it was worth it. The servers were really cool. Not uptight at all. The only thing I hated was they have rest room attendants. Maybe it is just me, but come on. I should not have to feel guilty for not tipping someone just for handing me a towel that I could have easily gotten for my self. I have little respect for businesses that do that."
1,Tim is really a very friendly and honest guy. He will tell you what you need or what can wait. This place is worth going to! It will save you tons of money!
0,"I was very disappointed in my encounter with them today.  I have been going there for years and thought they have done a good job.  Today I picked up my Tori Burch purse that I brought in to have a shoulder strap repaired.  The thread they used for the repair was a light cream color.  The purse and the stitching is a mustard yellow color.  It looks terrible!!!  They tried putting some cream colored shoe polish on the tread, no improvement.  Now the thread just looked dirty.  I told them that I was not at all happy with the repair.  They just kept saying in thick accent.  ""It's good, I fixed it good"".  They would not refund the amount I prepaid,  (prepay only store), or redo it with the correct color thread.  Just kept saying.  ""I fixed it good"".  Looks like I'll be finding a new shoe repair place."
1,"Went here for our anniversary.  Pretty much what you would expect from an upper end steak house.  Yes, it's pricey.  Steaks were good and service was attentive.  A good place to celebrate."
0,"While I give the management props for honoring our gift certificate, even though our total rang up below the minimum price, the food was teh ick. 

I got the fish tacos. I understand the urge to make them unique, and different from the thousands of varieties of fish tacos available in the Valley. But this attempt was a huge miss. 

The tilapia tasted pretty muddy, even for tilapia. It was served with a really sweet, sticky, almost BBQ-style sauce. I was alternately pleased that it was so cloying that it almost covered the icky river flavor of the tilapia, and perplexed at this odd pairing. The avocados also had a funny, chemical flavor to them. Double-yuck."
0,I don't get what people like about this place. It's generally crowded with rushed service and the food has yet to impress. I've tried at least twice -- maybe I'm ordering wrong but I really just don't get it...
1,"Why have I lived in the Valley for eight years and not been here until yesterday? Seriously was missing out. (And being such a Mexican food junkie that even my friends and family can't stand me warrants the trip alone). 

Chimi = Good. Not as good as some other places I've been to. But good. 
Everything else = Really good. 

Food is filling, and its easy to indulge in...

Service bothered me. Don't get me wrong. Our waiters were very friendly. But its like...

Dude...this drink has been empty for 15 minutes...why is it not full?! Had to ask for things, refills on water, more chips and salsa (Which are fabulous, by the way), etc, etc. Maybe I'm overly expectant and believe that water glasses should be full at times. Either way, its not a big deal. 

Carlos O'Briens - you should expect my business in the future. I promise I'll be good and go the gym soon thereafter."
0,"Oh, Sushi Brokers...what happened to you?! This used to be my go-to place for great ambience and delish sushi.  We ate there Friday night for the first time in a long time and they have significantly raised their prices and the sushi was subpar at best! $90 for 3 rolls and 3 cocktails. Grrrr....frustrating!"
1,"So my friends and I had to roll each other out of the door after this meal was over but it was sooooooooo worth it!!! BEST red kool-aid ever served in jars!! BEST waffles I've EVER had!! BEST red velvet cake I've EVER had!! I also did enjoy their chicken, mac & cheese and collard greens, but none were the best I've ever had, but very good.  I seriously dream about their waffles and red velvet cake, I don't know what magic mix of ingredients make up the waffle batter but it's absolutely perfect and these waffles would stand deliciously on their own even without butter and syrup, but who'd want to do that? the red velvet slice they give you is HUGE and soooo moist, the frostings is cream cheesy delicousness. I can not wait to indulge in this treat again, but since I'm far from being the only one who loves this place, it is always packed and the wait is long, at least on the weekend. Seriously considering taking a day off of work just for a weekday Lo Lo's run =P"
0,"First time there the other night.  Friday night, not very crowded for 7:30pm.  We were shown to a table in what looked like a back room - the table was not set, there was just a tablecloth and that was it.  The room is to the right as you walk in.  There were only 2 other tables in there and the windows were covered (no view) - it was weird so I immediately asked to be seated in the main part of the restaurant.  Decor seemed 'cheap' - just my initial impression.  Food was pretty good.  Pancetta wrapped shrimp app was good; Service was good.  Entrees were pretty good - Chicken Parm, Fettucine Bolognese all tasty, but not sure I would go back.  Caesar salad was a bit disappointing...asked for anchovies on the side - never delivered."
1,"I recently visited the Arizona Science Center, & today came to check this one out, joined by Mike C.  Ok, it's not the same thing, but I'd say this one rules!  There's plenty to see here, It's fun for both adults & kids.  A couple of the excellent features are an old MINE to go through, & lots of DINOSAURS!!    :-))

The walkways kind of wind all over the place, so try to keep track of where you've been, & not miss anything.  They've put a lot of work into this museum, & you're going to like it!

1,"Cheese Curds!   They have been so hard to find in AZ.    Like the Jalepeno ones too.

Really good fresh milk.   Worth the stop.

Bring cash, not credit or debit cards"
0,"Eh.

I wouldn't spend my money to stay here ever again.  The hotel itself looks nice.  It's large, spacious and the bar by the lobby is impressive.

But the rooms...Well I feel as if they're nothing special and the heavenly beds were not as heavenly as I had imagined.

The pool service was awful as well.  The managers don't know what they're doing and the pool is always overstaffed with lazy high school kids or severely understaffed with one or two servers for the entire pool area.

For the price, I'd go stay at the Four Seasons, where they actually know what good customer service is."
1,Amazing bagels and a great staff. I always get the build your bagel sandwich it's heaven!
0,"This place is so cool! The menus are on the walls in sharpie along with signatures from a lot of local athletes. They will not present a bill to you, but rather trust you to tell them what you ordered and pay the correct amount. The food is great, artery clogging, and comes in huge portions. I like the smothered chicken with yams and green beans, and order it every time. I always want to sleep off the rest of the day too. Saturday they do a great rib plate. Good spot for those working or living in the city."
0,"Very nice happy hour. Its dark inside but the beer prices are good and they have free sliders, chips and salsa."
1,"Yes I do rock the hipster joints.  I dig this place.  A little bit of a scene, but the food is solid and the service is great. Hard not like it.  All in all a great spot.  I tend to switch up my favorites but I typically hit this up for breakfast when in the 602."
1,"I recently went to my first First Friday (and my first trip to downtown Phoenix). After a few hours at the Phoenix Art Museum, friends and I hopped on the light rail and tried a new restaurant. Enter The Breadfruit.

Easy to find (sign on the street corner) on a charming and quiet little street sits The Breadfruit with a hostess standing out front greeting guests. You can see the very intimate seating area from the street and it was packed (a good thing for 8:30pm on a Friday night). We sat and waited outside at the cute little tables (way too hot to eat a full meal outside). We were offered menus to peruse while we waited about 10 minutes for a table.

Inside, we ordered two mixed drinks (a mojito vanilla for me). They were strong and very good. The mojito was very minty and refreshing and my mojito-loving friend said he should have ordered a mojito. (Read: Get a mojito.)

The Food: We split a tilapia patty (very spicy!) for an appetizer. (Patties are Jamaican empanadas.) 
I had the coconut curried tofu with rice and peas, ripe plantains, and veggies. This is the one of the best tofu dishes I have ever had. My only complaint is that Breadfruit needs to have more plantains per plate. They are so good!
One friend had the curried chicken and dumpling with a green banana, veggies, plantains, and a side order of rice and peas. Although he didn't like the whole wheat dumpling, he loved the curry sauce and the green banana. He called the sauce ""delectable."" 

Overall, this is a great place. Small, but great. The drinks are strong, the food is great, and the serve is prompt. Our only regrets are 1) not enough plantains and 2) we should have gotten dessert."
1,"Private Karaoke at Geisha A Go Go is the coolest thing to hit Old Town in a while!!   My girlfriends and I went this weekend and it was incredible. I have heard a lot about karaoke being the new trend but not until I actually experienced it for myself did I understand why, until now. We had a private room with a flat screen TV and drinks at the flip of a switch (um, can you say bachelorette party?!).  It was so nice to have a night out without actually having to wait for drinks at a crowded bar or being able to hang out with your friends without random guys interrupting with a cheesy line to try to talk to you. It was $75 for an hour in a private room with 10 of my best friends. And by the time you split that between everyone it was well worth the extra expense. 

Seriously once you try it you will be hooked too! I can't wait to go back!"
1,"yo, bro, let's compare forearm tats and drink some New Castle. P.S. everyone saw you bif it on your fixie as you rolled up to the bike racks.

for real, most predictable crowd ever!!!!

I can talk mad shit on this place all night long, but when it comes down to it, I love it. The location lends to its patrons- alternative college students living in the only historic (PHX like) neighborhood in Tempe. Plus it is right next to HTC, so everyone is sure to be rocking the flyest of  -50 gauges. puke.

but.......the charm of casey's is in the cats. they are cool and roam around. Also, the best patio ever, and lots of room. Don't go inside unless you can't get a drink b/ your waitress forgot about you (which is most likely what happened). Or if you like old dudes 65+ eyefucking the shit outta you be my guest. Also, one night after I was there, the next morning someone had charged $2000+ on my credit card for an ad in New Times. shady......or recession? I think I know how this happened, they leave your card within an arms reach from the bar inside, face-up so any creeper with 20/20 can get a peek and thief you out of your identity and money, or maybe it was an inside job???

but I really like this place and still have ""casey's nights"" even though jimmy eat world sucks and I live in phoenix. 

oh yeah, this place is haunted too....and if you are a girl do not go pee in the grotto.gross."
1,They get 5 stars for the only thing I have ever had there. Every single time I have to get the Pizza Nortena. It is out of this world. It is meant to be an appetizer but we get it to go and have it for dinner.
1,"Ever eat at a Steak 'n Shake?  That's what Freddy's is: a Steak 'N Shake kind of burger and it's delicious! 

I liked the fries too: very thin, perfectly hot, not too much salt.

Nice people, the manager made it a point to get me my meal hot-off-the-grill, even though I came ahead of the ""call"" and again he met me while he was cleaning tables.  {See my review of ""The Habit"": their manager never greets customers, can't solve problems from behind a door, always hiding in his office.}  Freddy's Manager was OUTFRONT, ALL THE TIME, WORKING HARD!  

Great burger.  Next time I'll get the frozen custard.  I was too full from my triple cheese, CALIFORNIA STYLE-BABY!"
0,"Have been to the Garage twice now and they are batting 1 for 2.   

Went there on a Saturday for lunch and the food and service was excellent.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potatoe fries which was original for pulled pork served on a pizza crust bun.  My girlfriend had the buffalo chicken salad which was really good, grilled chicken in buffalo sauce on top of baby greens.  Excellent beer selection.

Went there on a Friday for happy hour and got there a little before 6, there was a 30 min wait for a indoor table or immediate seating on the patio, so we decided to sit on the patio.  Hostess sat us and said a server will be by shortly, normal procedure.  About 10 minutes later no server had come by and the hostess returned and asked us if we ave been helped yet, we said no so the hostess said she will get someone.  Another 10 minutes and no server.  It wasn't busy on the patio about 5 tables occupied, all with food and drink.  We decided that they must not want our business, so we went next door to Sushi Eye.

Will try again, just won't sit on the patio."
1,Great Kobe on flatbread and the skirt steak is fantastic. Waiters are very attentive and helpful. I've eaten here twice in the days (conference) and I would go back. Their menu is diverse enough to try something new again.
1,"I only recently discovered that I do not hate Thai, having never tried it, so this place was right up my alley. It's literally 1 mile away from our home and has a pretty extensive menu. The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but if you're a fan of pastels and the early 90s, you'll love it here. You may even want to move in. Our service was a little slow, but the friendliness of our servers (yes, multiple) made me feel ok about waiting a little bit for a third beer. Overall, I'd say this gets a thumbs up from me and my other half."
1,"Truly a great place! 

The flights are FANTASTIC! The food great! 
Service also great! 

Try this place! --- Seriously the fewer words to describe the greatness the better."
1,"This is a great place in an extremity of the Valley. They serve both Korean and Japanese food. They are quick and attentive. Having lived in South Korea for two years, I can honestly admit that this is some of the most authentic Korean cuisine I've had in Phoenix. I typically ate bibimbap once a week minimum over there and I can't really tell the difference between Takamatsu's version and the stuff I had on the other side of the Pacific. I noticed they offer a list of other, more obscure foods I learned to love over there, including naengmyeon (cold, spicy noodles), japchae (stir-fried glass noodles), and several other dishes. They also follow tradition and bring you several side dishes. Love it or hate it, kimchi accompanies every meal, as do spicy bean sprouts, a tangy spinach dish and a few other random sides. It's a little bit more expensive than average restaurant prices in the Valley, but definitely worth it when you consider the sides that come with it, and a complimentary spiced tea for ""dessert."""
1,"My wife and I originally went last Sunday only to find it closed. But since I had a Groupon deal I purchased last month, we went back Wednesday night to cash it in. And we're so glad we did. Kind of hidden in a shopping mall with movie theaters upstairs, we were quickly seated and served our drinks with chips and salsa. My wife ordered the fish tacos (2) with rice and black beans. Tacos and rice were both good. Black beans so-so. I ordered the Cuban sliders. 3 mini sandwiches w/ham, cheese, and a Cuban seasoned beef - oh so good - with a side of sweet potato fries. Wasn't a fan before. But now I am. Fries were hot and crunchy. I could only put down 2 and took 1 back to our hotel for breakfast Thursday. Would definitely return for another meal when in PHX again."
0,"Good barbecue, but not great. I ordered the BBQ Sampler and shared with my wife.  With an extra side and a delicious chocolate chip cookie for dessert, it was plenty of food.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food wasn't as high as I was expecting based off of all the Yelp reviews. All of the meats were very tender... The brisket and pulled pork especially.  But they were devoid of significant taste and had to be drowned in BBQ sauce in order to taste anything.  Thankfully the sauce was excellent and readily available.  Of all the meats I sampled, the winner here was the ribs.  Definitely not the meatiest, but extremely tender. I could pull the bones right out and devour.  Delicious!

Outside of the food, everything was excellent.  I arrived at peak time on a Saturday night, and the line moved quickly.  It snaked through the restaurant and out the door, around the corner, but it moved quickly.  We waited no longer than 30 - 40 minutes.  All of the servers were extremely nice and helpful.  There was plenty of seating available, especially outside.  It was a lovey place to enjoy a meal.  It is unfortunate that the quality of the BBQ does not rise above ""medium"" to match the high quality of the rest of Joe's Real BBQ."
0,I don't get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.
0,"We went to American Junkie after we found a 50% discount from http://www.restaurant.com. They couldn't pay us to go back.

If you like velvet ropes, not being able to talk to the person next to you because the music is so loud, and being around people who are really into themselves, American Junkie is your spot."
0,"This is a sad excuse for a gay resort.  Sort of like a worn out version of Palm Springs.  We found the Zen Yard up on Maryland Avenue a much more agreeable experience in a better neighborhood as well.  Zen Yard is a far better value, with full breakfasts included and warm, helpful hosts as well, not to mention particularly reasonable off-season rates and hosts who are actually there for their guests."
0,"I went to Genghis Grill one evening while the Beijing Olympics were being aired. My experience eating here was probably a lot like Shawn Johnson's experience at the games -- not quite the showing I expected, but GG still managed to eek out a medal or two.

My favorite Mongolian places include soup and salad bars in addition to the ingredients to be grilled; Genghis Grill does not. I missed being able to snack on a salad while waiting on my first bowl. 

The ingredients were all fine; most seemed fresh, but I had to avoid a couple of the less popular offereings (for the life of me, I don't understand why bok choy hasn't captured the hearts of the American public). The sauces were generally tasty...think Trader Joe's bottled dressings and you'll get the idea. 

The highlight of the night was when I realized the shredded cheese that given to me by request came free and clear. Of course, this made me wish I would have asked for sour cream, too. 

You won't see a picture of my experience at the Genghis Grill on a Wheaties box any time soon, but the meal was pleasant enough for a solid three stars."
1,"This was such a good experience
I was up all night with a extremely severe painful tooth ache
I don't have health insurance so I didn't think I could afford a dentist
Friends and Family told me to look up a dental school and thats how I found A.T. Still
I called and they said they accept five Emergency patients a day at 1:pm
It was 11am but I didn't care I drove straight there and I was the first patient seen at 1p.m.
it cost $15 to be seen, $15 for the X-Rays, and turns out my wisdom tooth was infected and had a cavity

so they sent me up to oral surgery, it cost me $85 to get the tooth extracted
i was nervous and they talked me through it and calmed my fears
It didn't hurt at all, I was numbed up and the student did a good job

they gave me a three prescriptions to take with me and I have to return next week for follow - up
the follow up appointment is FREE!

totally recommend this place to any and everyone!"
0,"As far as teppanyaki restaurants go this one isn't top of my favorites. 2 stars for good service and a nice setting... I'm docking 3 stars for my food being over cooked and not being offered anything to replace it, and our chef not doing any sort of classic teppanyaki cooking tricks (making oil light on fire, flipping shrip at people, bouncing his utensils around.. ect). Decent place to eat, but not a value for what you pay for."
1,I think that they have the BEST pizza in town!!!! Way better than Pizzeria Bianco!!!!!
1,"This is a delicious neighborhood restaurant!

I can't speak to their sushi much because I have become such a fan of other items on the menu. The handful plus times I have had sashimi here it has always been good.

Now on to my favorites! The Asian nachos are a must get. Instead of tortilla chips they use wonton chips. Topped with a yummy cheese sauce, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. Their guacamole is a mix of avocado and edamame. Yum! Add some chicken and these are super yummy and great for sharing.

During my most recent visit here I discovered they have a new edamame. Bun Bo Edamame. It's very spicy. Too spicy for my tongue but the friend I was with loved it.

Saved the best for last - the Mojo dessert. I am not a big dessert person, but I almost always order dessert here. It looks like a sushi roll. You get rice krispy treats, rolled up with Nutella, ice cream and a brownie in the middle. Delicious!!!"
1,Woo Hoo!  Little Caesars opens in Fountain Hills!  Yummy pizza.
1,"I know Kerrie through my networking and we benefit from her presence.

I have not needed her service's and most of us don't plan on needing an attorney. But I am always reminded by a tagline that Kerrie often mentions. 

""People in crisis need company, Droban & Company"". 

How very true. When that time comes, and in these troubled days, it WILL. You will need good company. I would look for Kerrie to help and so should you."
1,I had Thai coffee and thai fresh rolls. It was good. The vegetables were fresh and delicious. Plans to visit again.
1,The food here is generally pretty good.  Drink selection is great.  Service is normally above average.  The only thing stopping it from getting 5 stars is that it's a bit expensive relative to comparable quality places.
1,"There is absolutely no other restaurant in town that has better BBq.  Their pull pork is just mouth watering.. Very juicy.. Great bbq sauce with a touch of spicy to it... Just perfect.. Ribs are unbelievable.. This is not a place you get a 5 star customer service.. if you are going here and expecting anything but great bbq, you will disappointed... It's a whole in wall and I absolutely love their food... I usually give a lot of points for customer service and treatment... but their food is so good that makes up for everything else they lack and I will keep going back just because of their good bbq...."
1,"I'm in (puppy) love with the new Wag N'Wash in Scottsdale...

I'd been to the Phoenix location years ago and remember wishing they were closer to my home, and my wish was granted... this new location is less than a mile from where I live!

Minnie and I popped in a few weeks back for a self-serve bath.  I initially called to see if a groomer was in, but they were booked out for weeks.  Doing it myself was actually not only cheaper, but it was fun... and a good bonding experience for me and Min as well.  Sara helped us out and explained our options.  We decided on the ultimate wash which included an extremely efficient shampoo and conditioner, brushes, towels, cologne, etc... It was easy and quick - bonus! Minnie was clean and fresh within 20 minutes or so!

Of course we spent a tad bit more time at the store doing some shopping and I was impressed with the dog food selection, homemade treats, eco-friendly collars and leashes, etc...

I'll definitely head back to Wag N' Wash again really soon... so psyched that they moved to my 'hood!"
1,"For my first time it was pretty decent. Just as everyone said it is pretty pricey. I had the taco plate which consists of two tacos, seasoned rice & refried beans. My bill was 11.57 for that. Pretty steep considering that usually runs $7 most places. But I can say 3 hours later I am still full as if I just left the table. The chips, salsa, & refried beans appetizer was a great start to meal as well. My friends have already planned the next visit in which I will try the swirled strawberry/mango margarita which is 24 oz for 6.99. Sounds like a steal. I hope the flavor is above the price."
0,"2nd time messing up our carry out order. Boneless wings have bones and no carrots or celery again!!  Hamburger with only tomato, cheese, and BBQ sauce had onions and lettuce, when we specifically said no lettuce or onion. Allergic to onions and don't like shredded lettuce. Thanks to Tiler for messing up our order again. Will not be back."
1,"The facility is a bit dated, but the service is great.  Dr. Rios is patient and thorough, and his staff are friendly and efficient.  Dr. Rios gave me several different alternative contacts to try in order to make sure that I was getting the right fit for me - it made a big difference.  Who knew that they make bi-focal contacts now?  They're great."
1,"If you've read some of my other reviews you'll see a trend. 

Kohl's Department Stores.....Brewers spring training...... 

Yep, I'm a cheesehead. (But if you EVER actually catch me wearing a hunk of fake foam cheese on my head, shoot me. Really.) 

What can I say? I like Culver's. It reminds me of home. It's total comfort food. 

Got one of their Wisconsin Swiss melts. What other fast food joints offer burgers with Swiss on rye? The crinkle cut fries are always hot and fresh. And tasty. 

Culver's is known for their frozen custard. What Wisconsinite has not driven past a Culver's, looked at their sign, checked out the 'flavor of the day', and gone, ""Hey, that sounds good!!"", and quickly pulled into the parking lot? 

If you're from Wisconsin or the Midwest stop in for a Butterburger and some custard....it will bring back lots of good memories. 

Like another reviewer noted when he said he felt like he was in Iowa or something.....well.....that's the whole charm behind Culver's. You DO feel like you're in Wisconsin or one of the upper Midwest states. 

Granted I'm not the best person to review Culver's....I'm a little biased towards it. But if you want a 'different' kind of fast food experience and you've never been to the upper Midwest, it's a heck of a whole lot cheaper than flying there. 

Give it a chance....see if you like it."
1,"Amazing.

Fogo de chao is nothing short of out of this world. It is expensive, but as soon as you start, you'll know exactly where that money went.
Seriously. Try it."
0,"Eh -- no. 

I stopped here for quick take-out one day while at work. They had no sushi at all (even though it's on the menu), and the menu itself isn't laid out very well for understanding what they have/what's included.  I wasn't there to eat onsite, but good thing -- very little inside seating.  The food wasn't all that good, and if the customer says ""to go"", then you should put utensils and napkins in the bag for me. The place didn't seem very clean either. 

Just not a good experience. Go somewhere else."
1,"Oregano's is my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Tempe! The food is delicious - I've never been disappointed by a single appetizer, entrÃ©e or desert! And since they've recently add Blue Moon beer on draft I could stay here on the patio all day. Bonus: The wait staff is incredibly fun and friendly. Just a really great place to dine!"
0,"Meh....decent Filibertos knockoff but the place feels like a major health hazard considering how new it is.

Just think Filibertos with less quality control and smaller portions."
1,"Great bar, great atmosphere, great service!

Citizen crafts classic old-school cocktails courtesy of Thomas and Rich.  ON top of that they have a few beers on draught, by the bottle and a pleasantly surprising wine selection.   

Food-wise the menu is kinda geared towards comfort and southern style offerings including mac-n-cheese, scallops with bacon and corn grits, dungeness crab cakes with complementary slaw, pork-belly, etc

Again, overall good place to go for a casual and relaxing drink or two. Will be back for more..."
0,"Einsteins in general has mediocre bagels at best, and their ""schmears"" appear to be highly processed.  I've generally given up on Einsteins all together because because their food has really taken a nose dive, as has the service.  I stopped by this location recently because I was driving by and in a hurry, and wanted a bagel (they're supposed be a bagel store after all!).  First, no salt bagels.  Aren't salt bagels one of the standards?  Second, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese (cream cheese being a $1.50 option) to go and that was my real mistake.  Whoever made the bagel didn't even manage to slice all the way through the bagel and put an amount of cream cheese approximately equivalent to a pat of butter on one-half of the bagel.  The other half was basically dry.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed when I got to work and opened up my bagel.  Stick to any of the local bagel joints like Chompies or Kashmans - they have much better bagels, and they will dump a brick of cream cheese on them for you."
1,"Make sure to explain to your friends that it's not a chili place.  

Every time I invite someone to check this out they assume its some greasy spoon that serves cowboy beans.  It's actually a upscale semi-formal restaurant and......the food is delicious and intelligent.

I've been here for all three meals.  The brunch is good but the dinner is what really sings.

If you like mushrooms, get off here and get your tail to Cowboy Ciao.  The Mushroom Pan Fry has something like 10 or 11 different types of mushrooms.  I'm not the biggest mushroom fanatic but even I thought it was awesome.

If you've ever read one of my reviews you know I'm all about a good burger.  The Wagyu burger here is freaking phenomenal.  Challah bread AND a truffle aoli AND some amazing bacon..........MY GOD!

Definitely recommended!"
0,"My sister recently took her '98 VW New Beetle to First Class Auto in Scottsdale, AZ for an overheating issue.  I'm normally the one who does the maintenance on the vehicle but I was ~600 miles away.  She described the symptoms as follows: overheating light came on while she was stuck in construction traffic and went back off once she was moving again.  I immediately suggested that the radiator fans may not be coming on for some reason.  Since I wasn't around to look at it, she took it to First Class Auto.

She relayed the symptoms to the guys at First Class and also SPECIFICALLY requested they check  radiator fan functionality.

They told her the water pump was cracked and leaking, needed a new thermostat and also replace the timing belt and serpentine belt while they were in there (water pump is driven by the timing belt on this engine--2.0L 8V 4 cyl AEG code).  Well, a) I personally replaced the timing belt, water pump and serpentine belt about 10,000 miles ago as preventative maintenance.  What's more is the car hasn't lost any coolant since the job.  So the water pump being cracked is highly unlikely!  I did not replace the thermostat, though.  Once she called me to tell me this, I told her to decline the work and either take it somewhere else or wait for me to make a trip out.

I had a job to do that brought me almost half way to the Phoenix area so I decided I would make the trip the rest of the way to have a look for myself yesterday.  FIRST thing I did was check the radiator fans.  I turned on the AC and the fans didn't come on at all.  I pop the cover off the strip fuse panel that resides on top of the battery and found a melted 30 AMP fuse.  Guess what that fuse is for?  The RADIATOR FANS!  Imagine that.  Being a car that lived most of its life in Michigan, some of the fuses and the fuse panel itself had become corroded and caused the one fuse and part of the fuse panel to melt.  The coolant level was exactly at the max level, right where it was after I did the maintenance on it 10,000 miles ago, not to mention I checked it before her recent trip to Scottsdale (didn't have to add anything.  The car doesn't leak a drop of coolant).

Local dealer had a new fuse panel in stock, I swapped it out and replaced all 3 of the 30 amp blade fuses as they were all corroded pretty badly.  The larger strip fuses were still decent.  The radiator fans now work as normal and the car does not overheat.  The hose coming off the thermostat also becomes pressurized and hot at the correct temperature as well, so that's definitely not a problem!  Fans also come on automatically once the coolant temp hits 99 deg Celsius like they're supposed to.  Problem solved!

I drove down to First Class Auto today to give them a chance to explain/defend themselves, but there was only one guy working in the shop who she didn't recognize and no one at the counter.  What great customer service!

So she COULD have spent the quoted $800 and STILL had the same problem!  She just got dinged for a ~$40 diagnostic fee... for an incorrect diagnosis."
1,Pizza has been delicious and fresh every time I've been there. The Chipotle pasta is absolutely the best though.
1,"The food here is amazing! So full of flavor, not fat. Healthy, and delicious!  Prices in the 10 range for a salad, and 20 range for an entree'.  The resturant is very loud, because they are always busy. The chairs are too small for my hips, making it uncomfortable to stay very long.  Oh well. I suppose they expect, if you eat here, you must be a size 6."
1,"Consistent is a great word to describe this place. The food is consistently great; the service is consistently great; the regulars are consistently there. (they're great too). It has a comfortable smoking/drinking patio and great prices during happy hour. The staff and owner is always (consistently) accommodating and friendly. You feel like you are part of the family here. 

Food I'd recommend: Any fish served Greek style, the Prime Rib, the burgers and definitely the fillet medallions with the gorgonzola wine sauce. All the food is good though and you gotta love the salad bar!"
1,"Recently, I found myself in downtown Mesa looking for a place to sit an write a while while my son went to a concert - I had 4-5 hours to kill. I planned visiting one of the coffee houses within a 5 mile radius but my lack of familiarity with Mesa made that a disagreeable prospect. Fortunately, I noticed Lo-Fi Coffee, which was literally part of the concert venue building, before I began my trek. Lo-Fi was a comfortable place that served good coffee. But what made me a fan of Lo-Fi was the barista, an Air force vet who was friendly and went out of his way to make me comfortable (they closed at 9 and he let me sit in  until 9:30 - concert lasted until midnight). If I lived closer, or if Lo-Fi opened shop nearer where i live, I would go back again."
0,"Let me preface this review ..I have lived in this area for 15 years and Chompie's has been the only option for good Jewish deli. In my 51 years I have never received worse service than from Chompie's They ALWAYS get the order wrong., Tonight after much debate I caved for my daughter who has strep throat. She wanted nothing else but matzah ball soup to make her feel better. So reluctantly I called in for take out at Chompies. I assumed the one thing on there menu that might be a safe bet and hard to screw up would be the soup. I returned home and called my daughter in to tell her I got what the doctor ordered. As I watched her pour it in the bowl we noticed it was missing one key ingredient......... THE SOUP!!!!!  When I decided to call and tell Chompies this has to be the 10th or 12 time in a row they have screwed up our order. This was more than screwing up a order. This was forgetting the soup in SOUP. They told me if I wanted the broth I should have asked for it in a separate container. I responded I didn't think I had to ask for broth in soup! I WILL NEVER GIVE THEM A DIME OF MY MONEY AGAIN.  I highly recommend to drive the additional 15-20 minutes in your car and find somewhere else when looking for jewish comfort food. You will be highly disappointed with Chompies. This is the first time I have ever heard of yelp. My son told me to come on here because this is a way to tell other people to avoid restaurants such as these. I hope you take my advice."
0,"ok so here's what they teach:  if you are a good person it is right and good for you to take from others and give it to yourself, because you deserve it and everyone else is a bad person.  Stealing is okay, lying is okay, as long as it is done by you, but for the others, they have no place in society, so pillage and destroy them, it is your right and you will be rewarded for that.  Wow."
0,"For a pretty yuppie place, Desert Ridge has a decent enough assortment of shops, assuming of course you can find them.  Sure, you can theoretically pick up some new accents for your living room, a new pair of shoes, some books and the materials to make new candle rings in one go after which you involve yourself with movies and a beer, but you may give up in frustration before you ever find a place to park.

I dearly hope whoever laid this place out is no longer in charge of such projects.  There is no logic whatsoever to the layout.  Trying to drive between the lots can verge on nightmarish.  Needlessly huge islands in the parking lot put leaves in the way of ever finding what's across the way, so navigating the place on foot is often out of the question without even taking the Phoenix summer heat and wretched drivers into consideration.

Desert Ridge probably isn't going anywhere.  I've never been there that it wasn't busy.  It's almost impossible to avoid if you have any significant shopping to do.  But, the restaurants here don't tend to last long.  They come and go before Yelp can ever get to them, leaving an endless strand of big box outlets and bastions of poor fashion sense."
1,"The Boulders was a first class experience all around.  

We stayed in a casita, which was one bedroom and had a sitting room w/fireplace (a letter on the table indicated they are no longer using the fireplaces for environmental concerns), a large bathroom and walk-in closet, and a patio with a table and four chairs.  For the ladies, there is a vanity with lighted mirror just off the bathroom.  My only small complaint about the casita was that the shower was a bit small.  The mini-bar seems to be a thing of the past, but the Boulders still features a well-stocked version with a half bottle of Cali wine, kettle cooked chips, water, soda and various liquor.  The villas were outrageous and would be great for a family reunion or that type of thing - multiple bedrooms, a large outdoor area for entertaining, with the garage (they're houses, really) converted to a bedroom.  If you're staying in a casita, it's a hike across the property to the villas - they'll take you in a shuttle bus.

The bar near the dining room was well-stocked with several single malts, and the standard cigar list.  Walk out back through the seating area, and you'll find the pool, framed by a gorgeous backdrop of a large boulder and waterfall.  A little cool for the pool in December, but it didn't seem to hamper others' enjoyment.

Looking forward to returning and enjoying more on-site amenities besides golf.  My girlfriend went to the spa for massage / pedicure and seemed pretty relaxed - what I gathered is that she enjoyed it.

There are places with cushier accommodations, but the property it sits on is what makes the Boulder's unique."
1,"I love Sapporo.  They have reasonable prices, a big menu, great music always playing, entertainment (people watching), etc...

Their sushi is very good.  They have fun drinks.  

If you make a reservation for dinner you usually don't have to wait.

P.S.  They have amazing deals for happy hour, but get there early cause it gets packed!!"
1,Friendly service. Ordered the Veggie burro. Should have gotten 3 friends to help me finish it.
0,"It usually takes a good word of mouth review from a friend for me to try a new Chinese restaurant. However, I was craving this cuisine and this restaurant is close by and tucked away in a small quiet strip mall. Wasn't busy at all on a Friday evening. We were greeted right away as we entered into the clean, open, no frills dining room. We ordered beef and broccoli, chicken fried rice and lo mien. As we waited our super friendly server offered bowls of egg drop soup on the house. The soup was a nice touch but nothing superb. I was satisfied with our meal but it was not the best I've tasted. Fried rice was a little bland. Beef and broccoli was delicious. Overall I'd say the service was way better than the food."
0,"Qver-priced, substandard food.  Never met a cheeseburger I didn't like-- until now, (NOT a 1/2 lb.).   Small portions of tired, room temperature ""fry-pieces"",  burnt bacon, chicken tenders so hard, they couldn't be penetrated with a fork.  Mediocre service;  didn't bring kids meal cookie.  Waste of $$$!"
1,"I can't believe I didn't write a review of Metro after my first visit but I got a second chance last Saturday night with Dottsy Z, Andrea K and company.  We had a reservation for 8PM for 4 of us, and at 730PM Andrea asked us to add 2 guests and when Dottsy called Metro they said of course, but please be advised you may have a little wait for the larger table. Which leads me to the only bad point of the evening:

We had to wait ONE AND A HALF HOURS for our larger table. We had all expected and accepted a 30 minute wait. After about 40 we went to the bar to get some wine and oysters (otter creeks = yummmm).  After an hour had passed and no one had come to address the situation with our group, I approached the hostess and she was very apologetic and offered to comp our bar tab, which was incredibly nice. 

When we were finally seated our server was friendly and attentive and had gorgeous blue eyes. Hello!  We were all starving and got right to the point with our orders: I started with the cucumber soup and no amount of yums or mmmmms can fully describe the delight that was set before me. A cold soup, this is made with cucumbers, buttermilk, dill and olive oil, with chunks of lump crabmeat and a dollop of caviar thrown on top, because why the hell not?!  Also, the soup came in a really large bowl and I was full by the time I finished it. I did soldier on to my main course which was the Moules Frites which is what I had the first time I came here and is a truly inspired dish with juicy fresh mussels, and a broth with thyme, garlic and perhaps a little white wine. Then to add insult to injury they serve the huge casoulet with a hearty portion of herbed french fries that were the perfect crispness and didn't leave oil on my hands. 

Sadly I had to leave some of those friends behind, but only because it was time for dessert! I chose pot de creme which is normally topped with brioche. I requested a brioche-free pot and it was no problem. I was served a tiny ramekin of creamy custard topped with a sort of peanut butter syrup/creme and three slices of caramelized banana. It was really yummy though within 10 minutes my heart was racing from all the sugar. 

I will point out that this dinner took 2 full hours (we left at 11:30PM) making this the longest I ever spent in a restaurant (3.5 hours are you kidding me?) which is why I ultimately docked one star. Based on food alone Metro Brasserie deserves 10 stars."
1,"This place was AWESOME!!!  My wife and I have been driving by this location for a couple years and finally decided to go in, I had a yearning for Ramen.  It did not disappoint.  We got there just before happy hour, which is always a bonus, but would still go outside of happy hour.  The menu is quite extensive, the bonus is they have Italian noodle dishes as well.  We have been told that this is authentic to Japan so I was impressed to see this in the valley, having been to many ""Japanese"" restaurants.

We decided to try many different dishes, and were equally impressed with all.  I had the TanTan-Men, a spicy Ramen with pork, delicious.  We shared some tuna sashimi, which was fresh and tasty (looked like real pink, no added color).  We also shared the Seafood Delight roll, which has tuna, 'krab' and is topped with a scallop, fantastic.  The last thing we ordered were the Spicy Korean Ribs, this was my least favorite, but still good.  Of course the Kirin (on draft) was flowing as well as the house Saki.

Overall the CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe impressed us to say the least.  We will be back to try more.  Thank you CherryBlossom, keep up the Great Work."
1,"I love this place. Just to hang out on a Summer day on the patio and have a beer is like...the perfect day. 

The food is awesome. The Kilt Lifter is tasty and thirst quenching. 

The area is definitely lucky to have such a place."
1,"I go here for the free wifi and the bleu cheese crumble salad. That's it. Bleu cheese, craisins, sunflower seeds all on a bed of romaine. LOVE IT. I don't think I've ever had anything else on the menu, now that I think about it. Free wifi will get me in every time, that's for sure! I chose this location because I was in Phoenix in-between activities, and didn't want to drive back to Gilbert. This was at the Biltmore, and yeah, you knew you were in a Paradise Bakery at the Biltmore. Kind of funny actually. What can I say? I like to people-watch. :-)"
1,"Went here and we had a groupon. The ambiance was awesome. Two stories down, you enter a cozy space. We were a few minutes early for our reservations and we hung out in the bar. Table was ready and I ordered the lobster dinner. It was delicious and they cracked it table side. We definitely will be back again."
0,"One star is far more than they deserve.  The owner of the property spent an excessive amount of time barking out reminders of hotel policy, was rude to guests and his staff.  The stay here felt more like being in prison with the warden constantly in your face.  People in the group that stayed were locked out of the room by management, forced to pay made up fines.  The owner ruined the entire experience.  If this is how customers are treated, this place won't be around long."
1,"Great food, large portions! My family and I really enjoyed our Saturday morning breakfast."
0,"Stopped in on a whim. The whole plaza gives me the creeps (although I do like Yucca tap room and Capistrano's). But besides the plaza giving me the uneasy feeling, that even an unattractive mid-aged man could fall victim to a mid-day rape, I forged on. The rewards were less than stellar. I cruised the aisles of items looking for something I could purchase to add to my already cluttered abode. No dice. Everything is in that weird period, where it isn't old enough to be collectible, cool, or culturally relevant yet nothing is new enough to provide an upgrade. The only thing I thought was cool was a couple obscure punk CDs in the music section, but I already had the albums on my IPOD. I didn't see anyone else buying anything either but everyone did stop to talk to the old cooter working the register. He looks like he may be a plethora of knowledge and stories. I'm not trying to steer people away, just saying I didn't have any luck, but then again I didn't seek guidance from the wrinkled prophet dishing advise and offering a safe harbor to those fearing the dayrape."
1,"I'd always heard tales of the fabled Sonic Drive-In, but it was like a whisper in the wind or a thief in the night...I never truly believed. Legends with tantalizing visions of juicy burgers, golden fries, creamy milk shakes, and flavored sodas came across state lines into Los Angeles, but how could such wonders be true? 

What began as an ordinary day would end in a night forever seared into the archives of my mind. As we were blindly driving through the dimly lit streets of Phoenix, an illuminated sign appeared to us, as if an answer to a prayer. Sonic came to us all at once in a haze. We ordered burgers, fries, onion rings, popcorn chicken, a corn dog, chili tots, and shakes upon shakes! Oh, the bargains! We laughed! We danced! We wept! The next morning, all I had was the echo of a stomach ache as proof of the marvels of the night before.

Maybe, just maybe, if I clap my hands enough and really believe, one will suddenly appear in the South Bay. One can only dare to dream."
1,"Attended the Table 12 Lunch & Learn event with guest Chef Mel Mecinas and was truly blown away.  I have previously eaten off of the house menu, so was expecting just as spectacular presentation as Chef Beau Macmillan presents - I was not disappointed.

Our party started the night at Jade, which I have written a review for previously.  Great place, wont go into much detail there.

The meal started with with an entree of a rare tuna, bacon, asparagus, and hollandaise sauce.  Second course was Korean short ribs, brussel spouts, and lotus root kimchi.  For dessert, twas a bourbon banana creme with carmel popcorn and candied walnuts.

The meal could not have been more amazing, and the service was just as good.  Have already booked the event on Aug 18."
1,"I love the White Tanks! 
It is one of the few parks in the valley that isn't completely surrounded by development, at the top are beautiful fields and you notice the fauna change. There is also water in huge white stone natural catchment areas, hence the name ""White Tanks"" 
However, recently there is a library being developed at the edge of this park, far from many homes and just plain uninspiring to think that everyone who goes there has to drive a good few miles just to read a book
Here are my thoughts on the matter that I wrote in this article about the new ""Green"" library in AZcentral
http://www.azcentral.com/community/westvalley/articles/2010/04/21/20100421-white-tank-mountain-regional-park-library.html

""I could not believe when I pulled up to the White Tanks to take a coveted hike through the beautiful hills, that the removal of huge cacti and the building of yet another public monstrosity was taking place. First of all how can anyone call this green? Can't we just leave one place in the valley free from so many cars, asphalt and brick? How is anyone supposed to get out there anyway? It is so far from most home development and completly in the wrong direction to support any kind of ""Green"" living and combining activities as most people do when they visit a public institution such as finding a place to eat lunch, a store to check out, or to mail a letter. Putting a library out away far from urban development and removing tons of cacti to transplant somewhere else is a crime against nature! """
1,"Wow!
Being a Phoenix native, we have enjoyed many a meals at the hands of Chef Gross. But this past weekend I was blown away.

I was planning a large garden party for my friends bridal shower. The record temperatures left my garden ravaged by the heat and I did not want to have sweltering ladies unable to enjoy themselves. After a small response to attendance, I decided to see what some of my favorite dining spots could offer me.

I had a small budget but wanted to keep it classy. Christopher's truly rose to the occasion. Alex, was my special event contact and this lady was ""on it"". Emails and phone calls were returned at lightning speed. She presented a delightful menu with plenty of choices (some even for the vegetarians attending) all with in my price range. 

We had a wonderful time. We had a party of 18 in the beautiful private room that fit our festivities perfectly. Sundays can be quiet at The Biltmore Fashion Park so it lend-ed us to a bit of intimacy that was nice. Ben was our go to guy. He was right there for every thing we needed and his helpers were polite and attentive.
As for the food, well, it's Chris, come on! I had the vegetable risotto ans  it was cooked to perfection. All of the plates came out of the kitchen quickly and all together but no one ever made us feel rushed. Wine flowed, desserts were gobbled up and the ladies oohed and awed over everything. the staff even offered to take gifts to the car for the bride.

Thanks for saving me Chef Chris and your team. You were all fabulous and I will be telling all of my friends what a great job you did. The holidays are coming and Ben reminded us that they also do catering! Hmmm, can you say ""Christmas Party""?"
1,"Teakwoods is the place to go if you are a ""wings"" fan!  They grill wings for crisp perfection and the flavor is so good that I don't even need ranch to dip the wing in.  I know - How can you not need ranch?  I didn't believe it until I tried it.  

Everytime I go to a restaurant that offers wings, I will be comparing it to Teakwoods."
0,"If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars.  But, I'm not  rating it based on the food.  It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but won't split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote ""family style"".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served ""family style"" someone else may get what you ordered and you won't have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was ""this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties"".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, I'm pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I don't normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.  The reservation was made for 25 people!  It would've taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.  Worst experience ever!"
1,"This place confirms why ""hole in the wall"" places are the best places to get food. Its virtually impossible to find the place but once you smell the aroma of home-cooked Mexican food, you know that you're there. Usually there is a long line; however, their service is quick. With the combination of their swift service and decadently savory food, Rito's is a staple Mexican food stand that everyone has to visit when in Phoenix. I always have a green chilli burrito and haven't quite ventured out to other things on their menu, but I have never heard anything less than positive about what they have to offer."
0,Our family made the mistake of dining here on Thanksgiving. Everything from the table to the food to the clueless and absent waiter was outright below average and certainly no where near the kind of restaurant described in the other reviews (which I wonder now if were written by the owner or manager). What a disappointing holiday.
0,"It was maybe two months after this place opened that I decided to give it a try.  I didn't go to the restaurant, opting instead to use their delivery.  I placed a large order for two (~$80) and the food was ready and delivered withing 30-45 minutes.  The food was of decent restaurant quality and definitely a good place to get steaks, but it was no where near the quality you would get from Texas Roadhouse or Outback and neither is the price.  I'd definitely recommend trying them if you are looking for a cheat, good steak fix."

1,"Los Olivos is a quiet resturaunt in the Old Scottsdale city near the SF Giants spring training site. That is how I happened on this wonderful family style eatery. Arrived to the area to meet a Good HS friend and was way early. Used the Yelp app on my phone and soon I was here! Seated with out any wait. The place was just picking up since the ball game was not to far off and it was Dinner time as well. Service was very efficient and pleasant. I'm partial to Chicken what ever in these Mexican style resturaunts, and had a 'Chimi'. Arrived shortly and enjoyed it emencely.
I would recomend Los Olivos to anyone. Looks as if they can handle most any size group as well! Everything is reasonably priced as well. Enjoy! Holla!"
1,"Yum yum yum. Husband and I first went there early on a First Friday night and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. We didn't want anything too heavy since we were planning on doing some walking so we split the Spanish cheese plate which was delightful. The fig cake is delicious!! Splitting the plate made the bill pretty affordable and it was just enough to fill us up without overdoing it.

The server was very helpful in suggesting a champagne for me and red wine for husband. Don't remember what we had but my champagne had a strawberry in it and was perfectly bubbly. 

Ambiance and decor is nice and mellow. We've since been back with friends and it has been enjoyable for both a date night and chatting it up with people. Enjoy!"
0,"Came in with high expectations.

Wonderful surroundings, I love the New York concept here. And the area attracts a higher quality of person, which appeals to me.

Place was packed on a Friday night of course , drinks were good, lots of attractive people, and a FABULOUS band playing.

However, the energy/vibe in the room didn't match the band's energy. There were many 40+ something men going after early to mid 20s girls/women. That resonated throughout the place. I actually walked around the entire venue to see if I ""felt"" differently, but nope it was all over. 

Not only that but people were indifferent about dancing in groups with strangers. I was there with my wife and she doesn't really dance so I tried to casually get into a group of 3 or 4 and there was no welcoming. I was disappointed.

So we left after maybe 30-45 minutes, probably never to return, unless people start raving about the venue, which will mean either the people changed or new people have discovered it."
1,"This was the first place my husband to me out to eat out when we started dating, OMG I loved it. The staff is always extremely nice prompt at this location, we enjoy their food and I epically am in love with the 99 cent margaritas they are the best. We always have a wonderful time here new and old memories."
1,"This park is fun for anyone. They have attractions for anything you are in the mood for. They have a full water-park, arcade,  go-karts, bumper boats, mini golf, etc. It is a fun place to hang out with your friends. Depending on what you are planning to do, the prices vary. Go-Karts are $5, Golfing is $7.70 (don't play the last hole, keep your ball, and go to the next course), arcade is addicting!"
1,Dr. Koch and his staff are wonderful! I know that I am in great hands and being given the best care possible. They do a great job at working you in to the schedule if you have a last minute pain that needs some extra attention. I would highly reccomend Arizona Chiropractic to anyone!?
1,Need your Bianco fix but don't want to wait in line for three hours or get in a fight because of a shortcutter? Eat here instead. Take out only and very limited menu but who cares there food is great! Lucky for me I live close by so I can bring it home. There sandwiches are made with all fresh ingredients and their bread is wonderful. Next door is a place called Lux Coffee House. Erick is a hoot. They are very good to their customers and I had the best Vanilla Latte every here. You can sit here with your Bianco sandwich and surf the net with your laptop. A small piece of paradise!!!!!!Be forewarned Bianco's is not cheap!
1,"I work across the street and love me some Hava Java. The morning crew is very friendly, and the coffee is great. I am a big fan of the Swiss chocolate blend, (or any of the flavored blends for that matter!) they are really flavorful without tasting at all artificial. I buy Hava Java beans and brew them at home, but when I stop in for a quick cup of coffee I always have a good experience."
1,Home sweet home love it ...only wish is more hot water for showers other than that it's a great place to live
1,"Hole-in-the-Rock is a cave-like natural rock formation sculpted into the top of a sandstone butte in Phoenix's beautiful Papago Park. It's one of the most powerful scenic views in our city, and is the perfect place to showcase its exquisite landscape. Just a short hike up the butte and you'll find yourself in the amazing chamber sculpted over millions of years of wind and water erosion. 

At sunset there are few locations that can rival its awesomeness. The hole faces south, giving a wonderful view over south Phoenix all the way to South Mountain.  

Hole-in-the-Rock is truly one of the greatest attractions in our city and everyone would be blessed to experience it at least once. 

No fee to enter. Bring a camera!"
0,"It pains me to write a negative review of PJ, but I just have to ... 
I was so excited for the new location to open because my husband and I go to the Indian School location any time we're down that way, and this is way closer to home. We were impressed by all the room up there! Not cramped like the other locations. Unfortunately, the food was not nearly as good! Both of our meals were not nearly as good as we've had before (at the other locations). 
Also, our service was terrible. We asked another server if ours was new, but nope: She'd bee there since it opened a couple months ago. She forgot jalapeno our hummus appetizer (to their credit, they brought it out after our meal and gave it to us for free, but it was bland and not that good). She charged me for a side of tahini, even though it was supposed to come with my veggie burger, and she never refilled our drinks. 
Overall, this was a very disappointing PJ experience. I'll try again one more time, but if it doesn't improve, I won't be going back to this North Valley location. :("
1,I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw that Country Market had a deli here. I picked up a roast beef sandwich and some potato salad. When I was eating it my friend said it sounded like I was having a mouth orgasm because I moaned after every bite! If  you live in the area and haven't been here yet try the sandwiches they're great.
1,"Good food and really good beer.  In fact, on certain days their own micro-brews are a dollar a pint.  That's right, one dollar a pint for liquid sunshine.  The pizza is ok, but the beer is why I go.  Try it for yourself, I'm pretty sure that you'll agree."
1,"Just did take out.  Great experience.  Easy to place my order over the phone, friendly service.  Nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance.  Made it an in and out operation.  Ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage.  My husband and son loved it and have already been asking to get it again.  I had the spaghetti calzone and was in HEAVEN.  I highly recommend it."
1,"My husband and I loved it.  The food was delicious. The ambiance very comfortable and child friendly.  I needed to dip my fries in something other than ketchup so they came over and asked what they could whip up for me. Who does that?  She brought out a yummy, very hot :) honey mustard. They should offer it on the menu.
You can also make reservations here on opentable.com"
1,"You don't come for the run-of-the-mill pizza. Nor do you show up for the cheap pitchers of beer. No, you make it here for the show. A massive organ fills the entire building, incorporating dozens of intruments, and the virtuosos playing it take center stage. Sit back and watch then perform your favorite songs, from Star Wars to The Little Mermaid. Don't let the average food dissuade you from a one-of-a-kind experience."
1,"We had a 10-12 person dinner here on a Thursday and our experience was so great that we brought back another 8 or so for another meeting on Saturday. Both times I had the New York Strip and both times it was fantastic. Great beef, great appetizers, great pours for cocktails. 

Our waiter the first night was a super friendly dude who was recently married and I'm sure our tab there was big enough to pay for a second honeymoon. Our waiter the next night was a bit more withdrawn but none the less got the job done."
1,Best Subway anywhere. Super-friendly staff and always really clean!
1,"5 stars for bein the only bar in Phoenix where I was first scared to order a drink. but- thats why I love this place. That, and its near the Trunk Space."
0,"They don't have the lunch specials on the menu or tell you about them if you don't ask, so make sure to ask. The sandwiches don't come with fries and their fries are over priced for not being very good. The pulled pork sandwich is good and so is the sauce. Also, expect a long wait especially if people are ahead of you."
1,"All I needed to complete my delicious meal here was a good Cuban cigar and some brandy!

We had the Papa Rellena for an appetizer... very very good. Its a beef filled potato cake with a cilantro lime sauce.

For entrees my wife and I shared two dishes... the Ropa Viejas (shredded beef brisket in a tomato wine sauce) and the Gallina Frita (crispy fried shredded chicken, onions, in a mojo garlic lime sauce....amazing!

Both dishes were large...with tons of meat.

Great service and really good mojitos make for a nice evening out at the Havana Cafe.

For dessert we indulged on the ""Best Of Phoenix"" (Phoenix New Times) Caramel Flan.... OMG!!!! And the coffee was yummy too! 

We also found a 15% coupon in DineInAz.com.... saved us almost $7!

As the sign over the door says... ""Cha Cha Cha!"""
1,"came here one night alone.  the hostess sat me down and kept staring at me as if there was a problem eating alone! i found that a little rude.

my waiter, however, was nice.  I only got the french onion soup and chocolate souffle for dessert since i heard good things about their soup.  it came out in this cute little cauldron, piping hot, cheese all gooey, and several crispy chucks of cheeses were tucked near the edges.  it was good french onion soup, although i have not tasted enough different french onion soup to judge it as one of the best.  

the chocolate souffle took a while to make but it was quite delicious.  my server brought it out and poured this warm choc sauce infused with some sort of liquor.  the etoh didnt evaporate so there was still a strong taste to me, which i dont prefer.  the souffle itself was soft and fluffy which was good."
0,"First of all, if you go here, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check your bill when it comes!  honestly.  We went here 3 times.  all 3 times we were over charged....  either the menu's were out of date, or we were ""past happy hour time"" (BS)... oh and the other excuse... we just changed our menu.  blah blah blah  P

then they always have to ""get a manager"" to come to the table, which takes forever!  (I am sure they hope we leave)  PLUS! THE SERVICE SUCKS ASS!!!!  this is a definitely bait and switch!

1st time it happened we just dealt with it, and was like, whatever...

2nd time it happened, my daughter who just got back from deployment (Navy) wanted to do something special for us and took us all there.  My husband looked at the check and noticed it wasy CRAZY over what we thought as we were there for happy hour.  The waitress had to get the manager which took over 20 minutes, (gimme a break)  finally we took a 30 dollar gift card because we were so sick of 'arguing about it.  We discussed it about 20 minutes and we were finally like, whatever...

3rd time...  took a friend there.  again we ordered devils ale.  on the menu it was listed at one price... when we got the bill, it was almost twice as much.  We waited for our server to come back, she never did, she totally ignored us.  I gave her a dollar tip (which is NOT like me, i tip very well, too well)  and I wrote on the recept why she got such little money as a tip.  

If you are looking for a fun time go caddy corner to San Filepe's  that place is fun and the staff are friendly and fun.  We much prefer there, we wll never go to Caddilac Ranch again.  They say 3rd time is a charm, Well, it is... its a charm to know you are overspending and its a big gimmick and they dont give a crap!

oh and if i didn't have to give a star, i wouldn't have."
0,"It's a hotel bar, so expect typical hotel pricing on drinks.  They have some good tapas to choose from, ask for the calamari, but a grilled version (off the menu)... it's REALLY good.  I've had a few of their drinks there, but I stick to the mojitos, but had plenty of others that were just as good."
1,"Pita Jungle is a staple favorite of mine and my boyfriend's. Healthy, hearty and great service. It's too bad that a lot of their prices have gone up (as have other restaurants) but I'll still patronize this place. Read as: some things went up in price almost two dollars, but you can still have a meal and a drink for around $10, more or less, depending on what you order. I definitely like this place over the new one across MCC on Southern - there's something about being by the lake that makes it special. Even if there are stinky ducks there from time to time. ;)

Ooh - and the gambas con ajos is my favorite appetizer! :)"
1,"Hubbard Family Swim School has become a staple for our family. You can feel the warmth and dedication on every visit. Our kids love it and are excited to come to every lesson. We even have birthday parties here!

The instruction is top-notch and it's evident while watching through the huge glass wall.

Most of all, my 5 year old is a much better swimmer than I am, his father. Thanks to Hubbard."
1,"This is my favorite hotel of all time, so far, at least of the Kimpton ilk. I experienced nearly impeccable service and a super comfy bed, organic and local products, a lovely shower, and general happy relaxation. I love that the gym and pools are open 24 hours a day. The decor, half Asian deco and half Southwestern, works works works."
1,"I've always wanted to go to Rokerij and when my date suggested it last night - I was all for it!  I was NOT disappointed.  

We spent our evening downstairs in what I can only describe as ""speak-easy"" atmosphere reminiscent of my days spent in the DC area.  I loved it.  Decor was spot on with stone walls, a fire place with comfy leather chairs strategically placed in front.  A big bar took up most of the room with some comfy look booths placed around the outskirts of the room. Lots of great details in decorations and design.  Our bartender was friendly and efficient. His suggestions on wine (1/2 price bottle!) and the manhattan we had were spot on.  He checked in with us and was attentive, but not overly so, letting us enjoy each other's company.  

We tried 3 of the small plates:  the roasted pepper bruschetta, tenderloin skewers and the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Honestly, I was expecting to be hungry afterwards and was ready to order something else in addition to that, but we held off until we received our food and I'm glad we did. The portions were pretty large and food rich.  Everything tasted great...the bacon and tenderloin were served on long plates that had 3 different sauces...a creamy queso (I think), a spicy red sauce and a green tomatillo-like sauce.  The red and green were really good - the white was a bit bland....but I'm also not a fan of cream sauces, so don't take my word for it.  The bruschetta was more of an italian style bruschetta (bread, peppers layered on top with melted cheese).  Tasted good, but my only complaint would be that it got a little mushy because there was so much topping on it. My date enjoyed it.

Overall, a great experience. I can't wait to go back - especially when looking for a laid back, cool atmosphere. And I definitely want to try more of the food!"
1,"Ringo is a tri color beagle. Ringo loves the dog park. There are so many dogs at chaparral he can run around with. The park is really nice, a big wide open space and is kept pretty clean. They have an active dog area and a passive dog area. We start in the active dog area and Ringo can run and get all his goons out, then we opt for a nice cool down in the passive area. Ringo likes to sniff small dogs. During really busy times when there are a lot of dogs Ringo can get intimidated and has trouble finding a crew to fit in with."
0,"This place is great but not if you have kids.  It mentioned on yelp that it is kids friendly, but they don't even have a table changer in their bathrooms.  I was there with my 2 year nephew and had to take him to the car to change his dirty diaper.  If you call a place kids friendly, you might think about accomodating and have a table changer in your bathrooms both in Potino and LGO."
1,"Found Indulge on a whim, based on their huge ""Gluten-Free Menu"" outside - I was not disappointed when we decided to try it!

Indulge has a separate gluten-free menu and the server was very knowledgable walking me through their kitchen processes to reassure me.  

I ordered my burger on a gluten-free bun (!!!) the first time I was ever able to do this in a restaurant.  That was EXCITING!

I think Indulge is as good as you make it - you are given a menu to check off ingredients for your burger.  They have SOOO many choices, that it's likely that if you don't like your burger, YOU made the wrong choice. 

I had no such problem - I loved my custom burger!  It was cooked to the correct temperature, was delicious & best of all, was delivered on a tasty gluten-free bun. 

PLUS, though I was full (it was a LOT of food!) I was able to take a gluten-free cupcake to go - wow, was that ever heaven later!  Thanks Indulge!"
0,"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but to be honest, it let me down.  The wild mushroom and goat cheese salad was phenomenal.  From there it was downhill.  Great ambiance, though I think they are trying too hard to be a steakhouse.  

Most importantly though...  Given it is a seafood restaurant, they sure didn't know how to cook my fish.  It was fried and oily (and was not marketed that way on the menu!)  I wanted something light and left feeling like I ate a ton of bricks.  My friend's scallops - she said they were ""okay"" and not better than that.

Oh, and the prices are set as if it were a steakhouse too. (Note: if it were, which it's not.)

Mediocre at best."
1,Amazing food and I prefer the atmosphere at this location.
0,"Beyond the attractive decor and nice food-presentation, I wasn't all that impressed by True Food. Certainly the concept of healthy, sustainable, locally bought food is great (albeit in the form of an upscale-chain), but overall, True Food didn't live up to the hype.

On the positive side, the edamame dumplings with daikon radish and white truffle oil were extremely tasty, and my Ginger Margarita was excellent. 

On the not-so-positive side, the raw ahi tuna app-special was just OK, and the tiny slivers of fish (maybe 8 total?) were more of a ""taste"" than a full appetizer. Even worse, my chicken sausage pizza was slightly burnt on the bottom, and tasted bland and uninspired -- the sausage was finely ground and lacked much flavor, and the fennel was invisible. Added to the long wait (weekend dinner reservations are a must even though the restaurant is huge) and the pay-parking lot (if you stay more than two hours, which we did because of the long wait), we all came away mildly disappointed.

With many other excellent Phoenix-area restaurants to choose from, we'll head elsewhere next time."
1,"Recently ordered Spinato's again and just had to update to 5 stars... as much as I've always loved NYPD, I have to admit that this really is the best pizza I've had in the valley. It's not fair to compare the two, as they're totally different styles, but it's just so good. And they're local. Can't beat it!"
1,"Great ambiance (though a tad noisy), food, service and views. For our meals, we got the following:

[Amuse bouche]
I forgot what it was exactly, but it consisted of tumeric wild rice and a piece of shrimp. Tasty and a nice introduction, although the rice was annoying to eat with our forks.

[Appetizer]
Bread with 3 dips - The pepper pesto was hands down the winner, and the other two aren't worth mentioning.
Butter lettuce salad - Decent, but a little too sweet for me.
Lobster bisque - Very rich and creamy with a kick of smoky flavor.

[Entree]
Halibut - Best dish in recent memory! Get this. Just do it.
Roasted cauliflower risotto - Came with very tender pieces of beef. The risotto was cooked well, but it was unfortunately too salty for me to properly enjoy.

[Dessert]
Espresso cup - The ice cream was delicious. The rest of it was okay.

After dinner, we took a trip outside to take in the view. We also explored the surroundings around the entrance, but it only led to an empty lot with the unflattering presence of a dumpster. Oh well!

The service was great, from the host calling to confirm the rsvp an hour after it was booked on opentable, to the sommelier suggesting a great bottle of wine, to the server making sure there was a candle in the dessert. Two thumbs up!

Totally coming back once it cools down to be able to dine/drink outside. Woohoo!"
0,"I was not impressed. For a business traveler, there are better choices nearby. 
When I drove up, the valet told me there was no self park, but I could see it less than 100 yards away from my room. I used it during my stay, and it was convenient and much less expensive. 
The entry of the hotel was constantly blocked by party goers, and I couldn't find any alternate entrance/exit. 
My bill was wrong at checkout. They adjusted it, but then mysteriously placed an additional unauthorized charge of $13.94 on my credit card. 
Seriously wishing I opted for Embassy Suites across the road..."
0,"Sacks is a great little place.  One issue and I know this wouldn't seem like a bad thing (at least if you are the owner) but it is a bit too busy for me.  I can never find a parking place or a seat.  The sandwiches are good and I like them, but I will admit that sometimes I don't go just because of the crowds.  

The food is good.  I like that they have a variety of sandwhiches and they put a lot of things on the sandwiches which can easily be taken off for the picky folks like me unlike other places where things are mixed in and not removable.  If you are looking for a good tastey sandwhich, this is a great place to check out.  If you are looking for a nice relaxing lunch where you can find a seat, move along."
1,"I'm a bit of a sandwich addict. This place has the BEST tuna in town, hands down! Cheaper than Jimmy Johns, a bit more than Subway - but the fresh, locally sourced ingredients make up for it. It gets a little packed at lunch hour, so I recommend calling or faxing your order in first. 

Try the #4 or #10! The potato salad is also amazing. I have not had a chance to make it in for breakfast, but I want to. A few times, I ended up going down the street to the second location because they ran out of bread (they are that good). The other location is a lot less busy and you might get hit on by one of the dudes there, but this one has Renee behind the register and she rocks (and also owns)."
1,"I love that there is a locals place right within walking distance of my apartment.  I've been drinking there for a couple weeks now and I love the good beer and cheap prices.  I just ate there for the first time last night and the chicken sandwich and curly fries are delicious.  The service is reasonable, the atmosphere is friendly, and the patio makes for a great hang out."
1,"Had to go to Gila Bend for something and while we were there decided to stop and get something to eat.  Stopped at this restaurant and we're glad we did.  We ordered the large meat lovers calzone and wings to split.  The pizza dough they use for the crust is very good.  Nice flavor, slight crispness and not doughy.  I'm very particular about my wings and when I verified that they fried their wings we ordered some and we were pleased with them as well.  They made them as we requested, slightly crispy, because there's nothing worse than a soggy skinned wing that's like chewing on a piece of rubber.  Our server, can't recall her name, was very friendly and always checking back with us to see if we needed anything.  

There was a group of men a couple of tables away that ordered pizza that looked awesome.  Another table ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and what I think was a very large looking burger with fries, which they had the same idea as us, split to share.  The serving of spaghetti with meat sauce was a nice size serving as well.  Another patron ordered dessert which, according to the server, was a spimoni cake.  It looked really good too.  

If you are ever going thru or visiting Gila Bend for any reason, I would suggest that you stop here."
1,"I rarely go to Indian restaurants. But this is a place I love to visit often. The food seems as if it was done with great interest. When u go there, order anything with rice. They cook it to perfection. I like their handi dishes a lot.

If there is one thing I can suggest, it is that they should stop adding food coloring to some of their dishes. No need to guild this Lilly!"
0,"Consistency is an issue with the Chipotle chain. Some of their restaurants are clean and well run, some are not.  They really need to trim the chicken of the chewy parts before they chop it up and throw it in a burrito.  That really sucks."
1,These guys know their stuff.  Professional staff and great location.
1,"They built a Sauce in Minneapolis & it only lasted three months. I'll never understand why, but I'm excited they are in Arizona & plenty of them. 

The Turkey & Feta salad is almost identical to my favorite at True Food Kitchen, which is a great thing. The paninis I've tried have always been good & come with a side of seasoned chips. I've never tried any of the pastas, but they all look wonderful as well.

Great place for a quick, affordable, good meal."
1,"I have been wanting to try Big Daddy's since it opened and finally today was the day for some lunch there! 

I was expecting cold mac and cheese based on some of the reviews, so imagine my surprise when it burned six layers of flesh off my tongue. 

The mac was HOT, the sweet potato fries were HOT and my pulled pork was HOT, so I do not see what the fuss is about. The fries are a little on the heavy, sweet  side so I could only eat a few but they are pretty good. The mac was dreamy and thank you for including some of the browned/burnt crusty stuff from the top... mmm I am a simple man and easily pleased, I guess.  

Overall I can't give it 5 stars because I think it's a tad overpriced, but I still think the value is good. I'll be back to work my way through some ribs and wings and wash down with beer next time..."
1,"Best Italian restaurant in the valley, as far as I'm concerned. Totally unassuming from the outside since it's in a strip center on 64th St. & Greenway (in the same center as Fry's and McDonalds). But this family run restaurant that has been here for years. Same friendly staff every time...especially love being in the bar area. A little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it. Must try the ravioli (either as an appetizer or main dish) and chicken Marsala with fettuccine Alfredo on the side. All entrees come with soup or salad."
1,"Yum. Only wish this place was closer to my side of town so I could eat there more often.  Babbo (doesn't this mean Santa in Italian?) is a neighborhood Italian food joint that gives you big, tasty portions of food for little prices.

My friend and I always go here with her fam when she's in town, and I always look forward to it. The menu is filled with tons of pastas and all the regular Italian fare you'd expect to find, but they also have some great, unexpected desserts.

They have this apple calzone that is so freaking good, but the only downside is that it takes forever to cook.  Order it while you're still eating your dinner so you won't be sitting there for another 30 minutes waiting on it. They also have a huge half baked cookie dessert kinda like the amazing one at Oregano's. And while it's not as good, it comes pretty close. The desserts are ginormous, so sharing is best."
1,A great family owned restaurant! Their lunch specials are very reasonable. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good Japanese food. My only request is that they open a restaurant closer to Tempe - I would go so much more often.
1,"I've been here for dinner and the food was pretty tasty. The mixed grill platter is a definite recommendation, and the chicken biryani was full of flavor. The only downside was that the naan was just ok. Not straight out of a tandoor like naans should be.

Their weekend brunch was decent but kind of disappointing. The chicken tikkas were kind of bland and there were no fresh puris to go along with the channa and halwa. 

But all in all, a good tasty experience and definitely one of the better IndoPak restaurants in the Valley."
0,"I like perusing Buffalo Exchange, but, whenever I bring some clothes in for store credit, I end up disappointed. They seem to give you very little credit for good items, and they are very picky. So I clean out my closet, take it to Buffalo Exchange, and come back with 3/4ths of the stuff. Discouraged, I set it on my floor and it sits there making my room dirty for months.

I would suggest going in to trade during an off time (not a weekend) when there will be less people trading. They may spend more time looking at your items. They also prefer the items to be in season, so don't clean out your sundresses until May-ish if you don't want to have to bring them back home."
1,"For the past ten years (ever since FunSports occupied the same unit), this place has been the one-stop shop for my biking needs.  From BMX at age 13 to road cycling in adulthood, SMC usually has what I'm looking for.  The prices don't really compete with larger chains like Performance, but they are reasonable and the service more than makes up for the difference.  When I was getting into road cycling, the guys at the shop were very helpful with selection, fit, and pricing.  A+!"
1,"I love the food!! Love for the environment.. eh.. not so much.

Mom and I missed our reservation at Cowboy Ciao's on a Friday night and a worker recommended us to visit the sister restaurant ""Kazimierz."" Ok, we'll go as long as they have the famous Stetson Chopped salad. My mom loved the salad when she went to Cowboy Ciao.

So we enter the restaurant and the place is so dark. How the heck are you suppose to find a table and read the menu?? We had no idea how the seating worked, so we asked a worker. We were seating within a couple of minutes. Mann.. we had to hold up the candle to read the menu. The environment is nice if you are just spending time with your friends and chatting. But to eat and see your food?? The darkness is not good for that.

Anyway, we had the Stetson Chopped salad ($12). It was sooo good with the smoked salmon, dehydrated corn, pepita mixture, and the greens. Yummy!

The Burgundian Flatbread ($13) was also delicious! I liked the crispy crust and the chunks of brie!! Wow!! The morels and the shallots gave the flatbread some sweetness.

Since I liked the food, I'll give this place 4 stars. However, I wish I could see what I was eating. Thank goodness I took a picture of what I was ingesting. 

The service and atmosphere is more like 3 stars."
1,"bank building turn to a coffee beanery is way cool. 

plenty of seats to settle yourself in and crack open your books and do your homework. the free wi-fi is helpful too, but the connection lags sometimes when their a bunch of people hopping online to check their myspace.

it gets chilly at time, i suggest bring a sweater if you're the unlucky one seated underneath the A/C vent. 

the vault room is great when trying to escape the loud chatter in the main room, just don't forget to turn off your cell phone when you're in there, it's kind of rude...

if you wanna be shaking out of your pants, i suggest the Iced Toddy. it's strong and it should keep you up all night if you have a big project the following day.

customer service is very nice and helpful."
1,"I have just relocated to Scottsdale and eager to find a great wine bar and/or restaurant with a great wine list...and 5th and Wine was the one place that everyone recommended, so I was eager to check it out!

I decided to check it out one night after work, and asked a few co-workers for some delish food choices to try...the bruschetta was the one to try!

I loved the ambiance, very social atmosphere, nice bar scene and small tables, but they also had another room for tables further away from the bar which was more chill and quiet atmosphere.  I was quickly seated at a nice table in the more quiet area, and could scope out the scene. 

I started with a delish glass of Charles LaFitte - Brut France sparking...which for $9 was a deal and refreshing!

I quickly scanned the menu for the bruschetta and my mouth started to water with the selections.  I opted for the prosciutto/fig/marscapone bruschetta and the standard mozzarella/tomato/basil bruschetta!  Both were totally delicious!  The bread was lightly toasted and a bit soft...not like your typical ""crunchy"" bread bruschetta...which I actually enjoyed more than I thought I would.  

I ordered the Beef Bourguignon Julia Childs' ""Beef, Wine, Bacon, Mushroom Stew"" over egg noodles...for $16.96...again, a total deal and totally tasty!  The beef melted in my mouth and the mushroom and sauce was hearty and flavorful!

All in all, the meal was wonderful, and the service was great - very attentive staff - Jonathan, my waiter, was super personable. I also met Scott Yanni, one of the owners, who came over to see how my meal was...and he was very gracious when I told him that I just relocated here and was very happy to find his restaurant as one of my new favorites!

I will definitely be back for more of their great menu and tasty libations!"
0,"This is the FIRST Red Robin I had ever been to (earlier this year).  The service is always really good.  Good Veggie Burgers, love the bottomless fries (garlic & sweet potato), cool shakes and mixed drinks.  One of the few restaurants to stay open late in this town!!!  Great place to come after a movie at Harkins."
0,"Music was loud as shit.  The food, Jesus Christ the food.  Lame ass chips and salsa.  No joke, like 8 chips were on the plate.  Salsa was probably one of the worst I've had, no flavor at all and warm.   Salads come out warm (I'm assuming this is why I've been puking).  Gross right, warm lettuce.  Waiter let's us know they can make daughter a little quesadilla (cheese only) which comes out so greasy.  Our taco plates come out 10 minutes later.  2 dinky tacos on each plate that are flavorless and luke warm at best.  Yes, they are spicey, no that does not mean they are flavorful.  I'm literally using my cell phone to see what was on the plate it's so dark.  Mint water was warm.  Gross and not refreshing whatsoever.  My daughter's quesadilla was $13, yes for 2 tortillas smaller than my hand and some 'cheese'.  I get it- make a dollar, but damn, don't rip your customers off.  So over the top lame.  Neither my husband nor myself finished.   Meal was $46.  Horrible.  Health department should go temp that place- I'm not sure the refrigeration is working properly.  Such a disappointment, I've been a vegetarian for 18 years- was looking forward to a new spot.  Won't be returning.  Ever."
1,"I have been taking vehicles to this place for 15+ years, mostly for routine maintenance, but occasionally for the other annoying things your car does to you. We have never had any problems with their service or repairs, and they have always been reasonably priced, fair and honest with us.

They also refill propane tanks.

Note -- this business has outlasted at least two gas suppliers. Previous names include McClintock Unocal and McClintock 76 :-)"
0,"Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? 

Be entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?

Are you 50 years old and Caucasian?

Then the Golden Buddha is the place for you! 

Its in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. 

For dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting ""real Chinese"" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.

The best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. 

They do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.

Come here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum."
1,"This review is a little late coming, but just got myself some fabulous chocolates and remembered how addicted I am to the passion fruit ones. It's a good things they're so pricey or I would probably eat an entire box.
Julia Baker also did our wedding cake in 2010. The cake was a beautiful three tier red velvet. It tasted amazing, we still get compliments on it. Julia and all her employees were a joy to work with, the tasting appointment was one of our favorite parts of wedding planning. Would definitely recommend.

Lost a star because they are a tad bit overpriced. Also the design on our cake was the wrong color, our wedding color was an olive green and the cake design was a bright almost neon green and we had asked for an olive or dark emerald color. If there wasn't a million other things going on I might have stressed about it but as it were the cake tasted great enough to make up for it.

They didn't last too long at the Montelucia, which is usually when I'd stop in for a treat. I'm not sure where they moved but I know that you can buy the truffles and chocolates (seriously try the passion fruit) at AJ's Fine Foods in the area."
1,"Best shrimp burro's. If it wasn't in the hood & make me cringe @ the thought of going in at night alone, I maybe would have given it 5 stars. 
The staff is as friendly as any other Mexican spot. The place is kept decently clean. Don't let the outside totally deter you from at least stepping foot in the place. There's a couple TV's playing Mexican music video's to get your mind off of waiting for your order, which is surprisingly fast. Call in orders are necessary when your trying to beat the lunch rush. But any other time, you could be out the door in 10 minutes. 
This place has been here for a while now. There is other La Salsita spots to go to in the valley. Some tweaked their spelling but all in all, best shrimp burro on this side of Van Buren!"
1,"When I get the urge to eat out, I'm normally drawn to more laid back restaurants where I can sit back, chat, and enjoy my meal.  With a relaxing atmosphere and fun menu (Chicken & Waffles, and S'mores for dessert), I definitely enjoyed this place.  My first time here was for a Yelp event so I was able to try just about everything.  My favorites would have to be the mac & cheese and the beef brisket--both delicious!  I'd say they've got their BBQ technique mastered, at least where the brisket is concerned.  And the cornbread is probably the best I've had--so happy they handed out the recipe at the event.  The service was great; everyone was friendly and very helpful.  I was satisfied with everything here and definitely would come back--and probably leave with tasty leftovers!"
1,"I dig this place, I really do, but the portions are small. They do make up for it  by packing a straight kick to your man or woman pleaser with zesty flavors. I didn't dig the guacamole-too much salt, but loved, loved, loved the chips that came with it. The place is quite spacious and modern with featured art on the walls. I went for dinner so the lighting was minimal giving the place a sexy, urban feel to it. The kind of lighting that makes you wonder if the people are really this good looking? Or is the lighting really just this good??? 

The carne asada beef tacos were divine. Really moist and succulent with just enough spice to make your taste buds tingle. Two is hardly enough, so we also tried the fish tacos and well, I could smell the fishiness from across the table which makes me a little uncomfortable. I did try it, though and it was okay. Not too fond of anything that tastes or smells too fishy. Reminds me of unsanitized, dirty, dirty girls. (Haha, had to throw in a visual for you all!)

My favorite plate was the ensalada cortada. I loved all the ingredients mixed in together, especially the corn nuts. Genius idea! 

For drinks, I had the la sangria. Fruity, refreshing, and light tasting. It was really good, but I passed it on to my date in hopes of taking advantage of him later on. Almost worked, but when we got to the normally secluded rooftop @ the Clarendon hotel, they were hosting a social gathering of some sort with lots of people. Damn. Should've drank my sangria. Oh well...another day since I will most definitely be back for some more Gallo Blanco. I can't wait to try their breakfast menu!"
0,"We ordered $40 worth of pizza for takeout and it took almost 2 hours -- was told 20 minutes. We were not comp'd for anything. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, they offered to give me $40 credit toward my next order. I asked for this in writing, and they gave me the ""we can't provide it in writing -- we wrote your name down and have you on record"" line.

Guess what -- I called back a couple months later and they had no record. They refused to honor the credit....and were rude. I asked to speak to the owner, and was told ""he's out of town."" The pizza is mediocre at best. I have zero tolerance for businesses such as this. PLEASE spend your money somewhere else that deserves to be patronized."
1,"Love it.

Last night I dropped into Romanelli's for the first time after driving past a time or two.  Glad I did.

It's a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats, cheeses and breads.  They also sell all things culinary Italia.  

When I stopped in it was 30-40 minutes to close.  I went directly to the deli counter for a sub and was met with a challenge as I decided which to try.  I opted for George's Special (ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella, pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers).  Given the close proximity to closing time I was expecting a sub on older bread that had been sitting around all day but it was still soft and very fresh.  The sub is easily the best I've had.  Amazing.

I also purchased a cannoli.  I'm picky about these things.  Too many places fill 'em and stock 'em and the filling makes the shell soggy.  Romanelli's fills them upon order just like the Italian bakery near a friends house in Newark, NJ (until last night the best cannoli I've had).  The cannoli was top notch.  Simply the best.

Right here in Phoenix, on one night, I had one of the best meals ever.  I cannot wait to return.  I only open they were open past 6pm."
1,"The best !

From my first shredded beef taco almost a year ago  ..i have been lovin' this place.
I also love the number 13 combo platter (.Mini beef chimi's ,Gauc ,rice and beans) 

The tacos are 5 star fresh and yum ! ... AND reasonably priced."
0,"I would give this place 3.5 stars.  The service was excellent and the view of Pheonix at sunset was nice.  I ate the wedge salad (nothing special) and the chorizo mac and cheese (yummy).  The highlight for me was the pudding trio, the honey date flan was delicious but the portion was small...which led me to savor every bite.  The other people in my party were satisfied with their food and there were no complaints."
0,"I like the idea of Sidebar, but I don't really love the place. The drinks are decent, so I would go there for that- though I just have never found it to be very fun. Once I went in and had an amazing bartender from Sanfrancisco- I really enjoyed that visit, but then the next time I had this bartender guy and he was really uptight and condescending whenever anyone asked him a question. It really bugged me, and it made it a less fun experience. I have never gone back."
1,"I've only ever had the carne asada quesadilla and churros, but they are damn good."
1,"My favorite Mexican food.  THE BEST BEAN BURRO ENCHILADA STYLE IN THE WORLD (yes I've tried them all)  Get the red enchilada sauce, and a tortilla on the side."
1,"This place is a bit difficult to find granted but well worth the effort. If you're shopping down at the farmer's market, need a place to study, or just want to plop down with a good book, Fair Trade will caffeinate you as well as  feed you such tasties as quiches, stuffed croissants, cookies, bagels, and sandwiches.  

The cafe was run by the church up until Julyish in answer to Mr. K's musing but they've been bought by a few of the regular customers and are enjoying a slow but steady revitalization along with a steady extension of hours.  They're also hopefully expanding they're menus to include more food food items as volume picks up. 

Additionally, they offer only fair trade coffee and teas so you can do your part to help fair trade just by sipping at a cup of coffee."
1,"Great quality. Their Pad Thai with chicken is the best I've ever had. Fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Their Yupha's Fried Rice is delicious with the pineapple compliments. Their Red Curry gets a 2 star rating for just being Red Curry (it's not as creamy, fresh, or flavorful as Thai Basil on University). It's a neighborhood gem and I'm lucky enough to live right around the corner from Yupha's Thai Kitchen!

Also, it's clean, bright, and has an inviting ambiance. It's perfect for a sit in casual dining experience, and even nice for takeout. 

Staff is friendly and attentive. 

Come here. Seriously."
0,My daughter and I went in for pedicures and gel sets... was incredibly surprised to hear the total was $120. even with a coupon!!! When I got home I noticed that my pedicure wasn't the best... I really don't mind paying top dollar for top dollar services but even with a 'coupon' it wasn't worth it. Won't be back...
1,"I've been going to this Costco location since I was a tyke, when it used to be called Price Club, and my parents carted me around in their giant warehouse sized shopping carts (Those were the days, and those huge carts were the coolest to sit in!).  The employees here are nice and friendly for the most part, and there are employees I see when I'm here that I remember from when I was in junior high, a testament to the happiness of the staff here if they've been at this location for so long."
1,"I've only been to the bar here. They make amazing mojitos with an array of different fruits. I told the bartender to surprise me when I ordered my drink, and it was amazing. She put a mixture of fruit along with the mint and it was perfectly mixed. I also had their spicy shrimp appetizer which I didn't really care for. So many other places make a similar dish, but much better. They also serve really good rolls with butter that come out nice and warm. The texture of the rolls are a little unexpected. I think they use tapioca flour as their base. I will definitely be back to enjoy their main dining cuisine."
1,"$4.00 for a lunch special in Tempe is pretty good, if you ask me.  If you're eating two slices of pepperoni pizza for lunch, I don't think you can complain that your pizza is ""greasy.""  (That's what they invented napkins and dabbing for.  Actually, napkins were probably invented for wiping your face, but they can be used for soaking up grease from pizza too.)  

I don't know that I'll go out of my way for this one, but I won't complain about it either.  If I could give 3 and a half stars I would, so I'll be generous and round up (Barro's, if you're reading this and see my generosity, feel free to return in kind with free lunches for life.  I think that's a fair trade.)"
1,"We finally went back to Merc Bar last Saturday night and as I suspected would happen, I liked the place a lot better when it was dark outside! My husband and I took my sister (who was in town for the weekend) to meet a few friends before dinner at Lola Tapas (review to come in a few minutes). 

We were the first people in the bar, which was a little awkward at first but kind of nice, since we had a fancy, chic space all to ourselves! We all enjoyed our drinks, including my husband's and my dirty martinis. My only gripe was that they didn't come with the blue cheese olives mentioned on the menu already in them. Instead, the server brought them to our table and then asked if we wanted the olives. 

I still don't think I'd linger at Merc Bar for hours (unless I was drinking Red Bull drinks to stay awake!) because I find the vibe just a bit too underground for my tastes, but I will definitely be back for a pre or post dinner drink."
1,"Food : Fried. Carbs. Cheese. Yum.

Selection: Main specialty and dessert. Sufficient. 

Price: Under ten bucks a pop. Great.

Parking: Sucks! I nearly died after having to park across the street (no room at the inn) via a running jaywalk across the 7th ave midday madness. However, I don't care. Gluttony is so worth it.

Hours are rather limited. Better for me anyway, otherwise I'd have to start popping Lipitor because you'd probably find me here way too often."
1,"Okay, I will start out by saying that I just picked this place out because it was near a bar we were going to afterward.  Boy Howdy, am I glad I found this little gem!  Upon entering I was overwhelmed with the idea that we were in an Italian friend's grandma's circa 1980's dining room.  It was quaint.  It was old school.  It kinda made me a little nervous!

The general feel of the waiter we had was extremely laid back.  Traditional Italian dude who was a little tardy in checking back, etc.  Our water glass was NEVER refilled.  Got a little more nervous.

They brought out really good looking bread and poured some herbed olive oil out for me (I declined because I have celiac disease and can't have regular bread.).  My husband said the bread and the olive oil was amazing.  I had called ahead and they said they had many gluten free options.

I ordered the Chicken al Berto.  My husband ordered veal and a side of spaghetti with meat sauce.  We started with a Tomato Caprese appetizer.  The tomato was slightly under ripe but the mozza and basil made up for it...and in the center was a bunch of roasted red peppers which totally made the dish!  Nom nom nom.  The balsamic was excellent as well.  I must now do peppers with my Caprese!

Then our entrees came out.  My chicken had fontina cheese, pancetta and spinach.  There was a little line of mushrooms in a marsala sauce which I'm not sure if it was supposed to be there or not.  I'm super happy it was!  This is close to if not the BEST chicken dish I've eaten.  The chicken was moist which is usually questionable in Italian restaurants I've found.  The quality of the Fontina cheese was impeccable.  The pancetta was crisp and plentiful.  Then I tasted the mushrooms!!!! OMG!!  Freaking amazing!  I may have to try the Chicken Marsala sometime just to have more mushrooms!  Divine.  

It took a while to eat, mainly due to the waiter's ""chill"" attitude but we shall go back again and again and again.  I don't care if you don't get anything included with your main entree.  The portion of entrees were HUGE.  My husband loved both his veal dish and said the meat sauce was one of the best he's had.  Fresh, fresh, fresh.

It's on my new list of first priority restaurants.  And I think the prices were pretty good.  Less than $15 for my chicken, $20 for the veal and $10 for the Caprese.  I'm so there next week!

Oh, and put your phone on vibrate.  They kind of insist!  And that's okay too!"
1,"The Valley of the Sun has it's prevalance of *Bertos taco joints--Filebertos, Humbertos, Rolibertos, etc. Way out in FH, the open late (til 3 am on weekends) and thought it's slipped over the years, there is no better deal in FH. Generally good to go with the Shrimp Burrito (even better enchilada style if you can handle that). Most of the rest of the menu is good, thought I was disappointed to find ham rather than chorizo  on a breakfast burrito."
0,"Treachery! Seek it out:

Let me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single P.F. Chang's I've had the misfortune of being dragged to.

P.F. Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food, with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food. They bill themselves as a ""gourmet"" Asian experience, which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entrÃ©es right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart. Everything is bland, overcooked, and ridiculously priced. 

Once you've paid nearly $14 for their ""orange peel chicken"", you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice. This is your second mistake. Sadly, the bistro calls you on your bullshit. You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.

Everything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy, things that should be sauced are too dry, things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods, all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.

Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F. Changs, while sounding vaguely Asian, is a wholly American creation. It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale, actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit, named Philip Chiang. (They literally cut out the poor bastard's ""i"" so that it would ""fit on the signs better,"" or, as I like to believe, not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.) It's highly Americanized (and yes, I've had Chinese food in China, but I've also enjoyed great ""American Chinese"" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of ""wok charred beef"", listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.

The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death. From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:

'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming. ""Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant,"" Jim told me, pointing at the statues. ""It's not lucky. It's something you put at a burial site! But in America, they think it's a Chinese thing."" From a Chinese perspective, P.F. Changs is decorated with death.'

Which is just fine, because everything there tastes like death anyway."
0,"All I'm saying is they need to do a better job at hiring their staff. The girl that helped us out last time was on something pretty heavy. It was a school night, and we had just finished up dinner next door at Windsor. We all wanted to get something sweet, but the girl working there was so blitzed out of her mind on something. She was barely able to interact with us. Within the first 2 minutes she must have asked us 5 times how we were doing. She never once made eye contact.  I'm not exaggerating by saying she looked pretty filthy, and was really rude to boot. Maybe that's just how the poor girl is, but damn, you think they could do a better job hiring people to compliment the charm of a family oriented cutesy sweet spot. 

She turned us off so bad, that no one in the party decided to order anything.

I give it 3 stars because I've been before, and thought their stuff  was good, not great. Churn is pretty damn adorable & local, so they get extra love for that. So, for now, until something better comes along it will just have to do."
0,"You've seen the storyline play out many times - great athlete in his prime signs a multi-year mega-contract, but eventually his body betrays him and he's parked on the bench, getting paid more than the starters.

Valle Luna, I'm looking at you.

My family used to frequent this place - you could get a nice meal for $8 or $9 per person, and their food was fantastic.

But Valle Luna has lost a step.  You see it here and there - the chimi sauce isn't quite the same, the beans are inconsistent, and the fundido just isn't as fun.  And to make matters worse, Valle Luna now demands superstar prices, asking for around $20 for a chimichanga dinner.  I hate to break this to you, guys, but I can get that - and done better - for much cheaper.  And don't even get me started on the rise of Rito's, Chipotle, and Juan's, all of which provide superior food for less than half the price.

Their prices have become ridiculous - and I think Valle Luna knows it, because this is one of the only restaurants I can think of that creates a version of their menu WITH NO PRICES for their website.  I'm serious: http://www.valleluna.com/VL_Menu3.html  It looks exactly like the regular menu, just without any idea of how crazy expensive their food has become.  I suppose they figure that you can't (or won't) leave after you've sat down, ordered drinks, and eaten some chips?

But much like that past-his-prime athlete, Valle Luna still has one move that reminds you of those glory days, like Jordan's fade-away jumper.  It was his best shot late in his career because it was the only shot he could cleanly get off.   Valle Luna's fried ice cream is so delicious, and since it's dessert, they can't charge $18 for it.   I wish I could tell you the exact price but that's censored on the online menu, too.   

So go for dessert sometime soon and reminisce about the glory days, because I suspect it won't be long before the game passes Valle Luna by and they're forced to hang up the aprons."
1,"This was the marriage of two of my favorite things alcohol and ice cream.  As Charlie Sheen would say ""Winning!!!!""

I had a groupon so Laura A. and I went to try out this amazing place.  The groupon got us each two scoops so we went with 4 different so we could sample the most possible.  I got the Apple Pie / Spiced Rum and Black Raspberry / Chambord Liqueur.  Both were awesome I actually enjoyed the Chambord the most but I was in ice cream heaven.  

Laura got the Mimosa with Champagne and the Margarita / Tequila.  I really enjoyed both of her's the margarita was a strawberry one which is my fav.  The Mimosa was very refreshing and I could imagine that being a great hangover remedy at about 11am on a Saturday =) just sayin.  

I have found a new place to cure my sweet cravings and can't wait to try more flavors as the website has many more I didn't see in store so I assume they are on rotation which is great.  

I hope that eventually I can find a pinapple upside down cake with rum flavor"
1,"i think this food is phenomenal. this was the first place i tried asian food in AZ when moving out here years ago. it has grown since then and the food is always top notch. 

for a late sunday afternoon lunch, the place was nearly empty but their takeout counter was constantly busy. our server was friendly and attentive and kept our water glass filled. 

it's been a while since i ate for the review for which i write so i don't remember exactly what it was, but it had the big, wide rice noodles which i love. i do remember that the dish was excellent and big enough to supply leftovers for lunch the next day. 
they ask how spicy and i've eaten thai food ""spicy"" and it is downright dangerous, so we opted for ""medium"" with a side of spice juice...which was HOT!

we will continue to patronize Tottie's as they are consistent and the food and service has always been very, very, very good. and very reasonable prices."
1,"Reasonable prices, good service, over-priced snacks (like every other theater) and comfy seats! I do enjoy this AMC very much though when I have to come here versus the Harkins on Northern.

The one MAJOR drawback and this is a BIG WARNING is that if you go on the day of a Cardinals home game, EVERYONE and I do mean EVERYONE has to pay $10 to park in the parking lots at Westgate. The parking attendants will give you a ticket to take inside and AMC has a person there to give you back the $10 but the fact that you have to pay it to begin with sucks. What if I didn't have cash on me? This by no means is AMC's fault. I suspect it's the City of Glendale's or the Cardinal's convoluted way to soak people but at least you do get the money back if you are paying attention."
0,"What can I say... I am a bargain shopper! I'm not cheap, but I get more satisfaction out of getting a bargain than I do spending a ton of money for a name brand item at Nordstrom or Sax Fifth. That being said, sure you can find a pair of shoes you'll like here, but the selection is simply OK, and its usually full retail price. Most of the time they have a two-for-one deal or get the second pair half price. Still, its never really any kind of sweet deal."
0,I was here for a business dinner recently and loved their new hummus plate.  They put grilled zucchini on it and had some fresh jicama which was awesome.  I wasn't in the mood for BBQ at the time but so I ordered a turkey burger which came on a whole wheat bun and some steamed broccoli.  I love the healthy options.  Thanks to Red Robin for helping to fight the battle of the bulge.  Just make sure you bring lots of will power when come here because it's easy to blow it...especially with the desert menu!!
1,"Superb service and food. Better than average wine list. Steaks and seafood were cooked expertly, sides were just right. Seafood tower was put together appropriately for our 6 person group. I gave 4, not 4 1/2 or 5, stars because it was just tood darned dark and noisy. But still an excellent experience. Pricey as expected, but not overpriced."
1,"I was excited to check out Sleepy Dog after seeing all of it's 4 and 5-star reviews, and finally made it in. I must say...both beers I enjoyed were delicious. Establishment itself is small but unique and modern, and their whole theme around dogs rocks. The only drawback, is they do not serve food....well, the whole reason I went here was to meet up with a friend for dinner and a beer or two. I was shocked at this. We ended up having a pizza delivered from a pizza place down the street, which went well with our beers. One great thing, was they have a ton of flat screens all around. One had a corny late 80's action movie playing which was very entertaining, and something you don't experience everyday. All in all, I did like Sleeping Dog, and would like to go back. I saw the popcorn maker as we left! Beer was just as good/better than the other breweries in the area."
0,"The service at this location is absolutely atrocious. I went to the Starbucks to get a Frappuccino, as I've done many times at this location without issue. The employee working the counter had an absolutely revolting tattoo near her collar bone and a scowl on her face. She asked me if I had a membership AFTER I had swiped my card, then said ""Too late,"" when I told her I had one.

Then, the idiot with the spiky blonde hair made me a Frappuccino that was basically brown water. I told her to make it again. She made it again, then informed me that she put extra shots of chocolate in it, and I should ask for extra chocolate if I don't want it to taste like water. I have never had a problem with the way my drink tasted until that day, but apparently the problem lies with me.

I'm not the one who chose a career in customer service. If the coffee slingers at this branch can't pretend to enjoy their jobs, they should be put out on the street."
1,"They had me at Baked.Goat.Cheese.   The appetizers were phenomenal, we got the Bake Goat Cheese that came with their freshly baked brick oven bread and my bf got the Romaine salad with fuji apple & bacon.  But the baked cheese was by far the better of the two.

Main courses also didn't disappoint we ordered the white fish and hanger steak.  I only had a bite of the fish so I can't speak that much to it, the bf enjoyed it.. it had too much lemon in the sauce for me, but I hate lemon flavoring so it's probably better to take his word for it!   The steak had this amazing sauce that accompanied it that added such a nice flavor to compliment the steak.  Both entrees were pretty good size portions, especially after appetizers. And we also split a side of sweet corn polenta that we couldn't finish

The actual restaurant its self is very open, there is an outside covered patio and a smaller patio for the bar that's out in the open.  

Valet only, complementary

Sat Night wait time: approx 20 mins

Clientele: On Sat night we had a big table of your typical Scottsdale Cougars, average couples and groups ranging from mid 20s to 60s and a bachelorette party of 4 girls who were barely 21 (not the typical place for a bachelorette party)"
1,"best place in scottsdale to watch a game. Great food (greasy, but what bar food isn't?), great drink specials, and an even better atmosphere. The owner came by and greeted us and made us feel very welcome. I will definitely return in the future."
1,"FILLY-B's!!!!!  only 8 reviews?? NINE now!!!

wow do i miss THIS place:

- 24hrs
- drive-thru or walk up only
- ridiculously cheap
- ridiculously tasty

of course the arizona burritos are good, everything is good. i used to LOVE one of the combos... you get a beef burrito, taco, rice and beans... for UNDER $6.  wow.  color me silly and call me sally. they have bomb horchata too.

really good and fresh flautas/rolled tacos and breakfast burritos. damn, everything here is good, whether drunk or sober."
1,"I absolutely LOVE Club SAR! I joined back in 2010 (I think...). At first, I just went there with my ex (who lived in So Cal and had been boxing) because I have always loved the sport of boxing and wanted to get into it myself (maybe even join the boxing team).  Sadly, I exceeded the age limit to join the boxing team, by a few years...  :-(
But, at least I could still learn and get fit.  :-)
We just walked up to the entrance and just took one quick look around and it seemed crowded and small so we were not impressed. So, we left.
I found out this used to be just a boxing gym before but eventually they added other classes and equipment for others to enjoy. 

Glad I went back later on my own and found out how affordable it was!
I checked and tried a few other Fitness centers and gyms nearby but, when I decided to actually try one of Club SAR's boxing classes, I was hooked! For a mere $3  (a day) drop-by fee, I was able to get one of the best workouts I ever had. I joined after I found out it only cost $75 for the whole YEAR which includes ALL the classes I can take (Boxing, boxing conditioning, Yoga, spin class, kickboxing, weight training, MMA... Yes! MMA too, which I personally love.  :-) ). Jonathan & Carlos are great and so is Tom. They're funny, friendly, and they actually remember you after only a few classes. 
The pricing has gone up this year but it is still by far, the BEST possible deal you can find anywhere in the Valley. 

Fees 
 
YEARLY Membership  Resident    Non-Resident 
Adult (18+ years)       $99                  $150 
Child (14-17 years)    $50                  $75 
Daily Drop-In Fee $3 Residents; $5 Non-Residents
 
If you are serious about getting fit, staying in shape and getting a good old-fashioned workout without all the ""posing"" and pretentiousness of other gyms which are more like ""meeting places"" and ""meat markets"" for the young Scottsdale wannabes, this gym is definitely for you!

Personally, I recommend the boxing classes because they will kick your butt, they are fun, get you fit and, in shape. :-)
They just got new heavy bags so there are 2 heavy bags, 1 hooks bag, several ""Bob bags"", 2- double-ended bags and 3 speed bags in the main workout areas. Plus, a bunch more standing weighted-base heavy bags in the other ""kickboxing/Yoga room. And, in case you didn't notice from the picture, a full-size boxing ring. 
Yes. I am totally endorsing this gym! 

P.S. This is a ""no frills"", serious gym. 
So, no whinnying and crying. Suck it up and do some push-ups!  ;-)

0,"i think reviews for this place are based on happy hour experiences. the food was SHOCKINGLY hot and fast out the kitchen. methinks there's some heavy microwave usage going on. the interior of the restaurant is and dark and fancy, but the food is mediocre and overpriced.  in fact, the roaring fork became both a barometer and a joke for the remainder of our visit in scottsdale.

if you want an equally priced meal with amazing food, yelp something else closer to oldtown (might i suggest something from the Baratin/FnB empire)?"
0,"Strange just strange. I park here when I travel out of town. I used the valet parking once last year and don't remember any issues. Today was my second time... I dropped my car off last week. The airport shuttle was waiting for me at baggage claim when my flight landed at midnight. I went to pick up my car after a long flight as was told ""it's at the front"", the valet guy pointed and disappeared. I was left standing alone wondering if there was another side of the hotel where my car was?? I walked into the lobby and the receptionist was quick to tell me there is a balance on my account. Huh?? Number one I don't have an account at the hotel and number two I didn't stay here overnight. Again I'm standing there thinking what is going on, is he getting my mixed up with someone else? Finally he explained the parking wasn't prepaid and I needed to pay in a order to get my car. He gave me a bit of an attitude as if I was refusing to pay. Dude, it's 12:30am, I just got off a long flight & didn't realize my fiancÃ© didn't prepay online when he set the whole thing up for me online. All this confusion could have been spared if the valet guy would have just said ""you pay at the desk"" instead of ""its at the front"" which is unclear and indirect. I think next time I go out of town ill try a different parking garage."
1,"Shimogamo has been one of my favorites for a few years now so, i thought it was time to give them a YELP!  Every time I visit I am always greeted by the owner (Yoshi) who happens to be Japanese and runs the restaurant as such. Fish is always fresh and consistently high quality, sushi chefs are friendly and always willing to let you try something new. They also have a nice selection of cold sake's available and some random ones in stock off the menu if you ask the owner.
   Atmosphere is very modern/contemporary and in a small suite located next to C-Fu Gourmet. They also have a traditional Japanese seating room in the back that is fun for larger groups etc.. If you are a sushi lover or even a newbie to this style, you will love it!"
1,"This place does it right, but hold on to your walet! U have to try the Yellow butter cake, its over the top."
1,"There's no business like show business. As any of my friends will tell you I am a theater junkie. I could sit in a theater all day, all week, all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent. lol! Well in actuality, hmmmmmmm I really could. I am not even joking on that. I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again. LOL!  Ok, seriously now, Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons. 
   My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are. This is children's theater at it's best! The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus. The kids love it. I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show. I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students. Teehee!  ( Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets) 
   I have seen so many wonderful plays, literature remakes, and original scripts performed At TCPA and by Childsplay. Fernidad, BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors. Debbie, Scott, Katie, Jodi; well all of them! LOVE YOU!
   Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools. We have had an artist at our school for several years. It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future. Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage.  
   Of importance to note, TCPA is a beautiful facility. You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent. What more can you ask for?  
   The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families. But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets. A great way to start viewing them and get involved.
    I do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in Az. As I have stated in my other ""ARTS"" reviews, I do worry about cultural program survival in Az with recent state budget cuts. Soooooooo, as a famous circus/rodeo person once said, ""Go, On With The Show""."
0,"I've been here 3 times.  The first was fair, so I gave it another shot, second time fair again, third time (kyoto was closed soooo....) let me start by saying, I've been in the service industry for awhile.  I know the difference between good and bad service.  If they had been busy this would be one thing, but there was us and a few people at the bar.  NEVER HAVE I WANTED TO THROW MY BURGER AT SOMEONE AS MUCH AS OUR SERVER.  The server was an idiot and the food was ALL burnt... medium burgers are not CHARRED on the outside and RAW on the inside.  Steamed veggies are not CHARBROILED asparagus... everything was so horrible.  We didn't complain, but we did ask about the charcoal that was our veggies....  Which we were given a crappy attitude in response.  We weren't even looking for it to be taken off our bill, just a recognition that the food was TOTALLY burned and half our orders were wrong. BTW there was no offer made either to fix anything...  in times like these SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE AND QUALITY / CONSISTENCY will get you through.   if you don't know what a good meal is and you want to think you're cool cause you hang out in a place that looks like it was furnished by IKEA, you should try it.  There are better places to spend hard earned money."
0,"Yes I am writing a review about Red Lobster, don't judge me!! You all know you love those little cheddar biscuits more then life itself! 

Seriously, Those biscuits, good lord! 

Hubs and I went here last night, his picking. He loves him some Ultimate Feast. I usually stick to the coconut shrimp. 

Our waitress was awesome, the place was packed to the gills but we never really had to wait for refills. She did forget to put in for the beer hubs ordered, but he lived (YAY)! 

The food comes out hot and fast. 

We also got an appetizer, did the ""pick two"" the mozzarella sticks were surprisingly good and the calamari wasn't just fried calamari but it came with fried broccoli and red peppers as well, super tasty!"
0,"Food was amazing but the service was horrible! I would suggest to take out don't dine in. I ordered the eggs Benedict, instead of Canadian bacon, they put crispy bacon on it served it with hash browns and a salad with a balsamic vinegarette. 

The two girl working there were so unprofessional from their interaction to the attire."
0,"So I ventured in here today for a quick nosy hoping to see what was on sale. I figured nothing in these economic times could be TOO expensive...They had a lot of their items FULL PRICE much to my disdain, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a large bin on throw pillows for 75% I personally was in need for some and bought some super cute ones for $6.00 each originally $35.00 yeah great deal!!! So I was a happy camper...I even found two that matched that weren't damaged SCORE...

They were setting up for Christmas so it was a little jumbled, but they had some cute Halloween stuff out but it was weird half the stuff was marked down and half wasn't, it was so confusing I just passed. I don't like the guessing game, either mark down the season or don't KWIM?

All in all though a typical Pier One except for how disjointed everything was it was hard to find things, and they just don't have the cute sets of furniture like they used to :("
0,"What's not to like?  Stingray does stylish sushi and happy hours just fine.  This is the only ""chainy"" sushi place that I will eat at.  I can't stand sushi at Kona or, god forbid Ra.  I have always found the sushi to be fresh tasting, especially the salmon skin roll, which for some reason, is absent in a lot of establishments.  One of my other favorites is the summertime roll, it's tuna and avocado delicately wrapped in soy paper which I love.  They also do a very adequate and lively happy hour where house drinks are half priced, and there is a nice variety of sushi rolls and apps that are between $3-$8, oh and sake bombers too! We went specifically for the fact that their happy hour lasts until 7pm, and they have a great patio.  We have always received attentive service, and when sitting at the sushi bar, you receive complimentary edamame and miso soup (although their version is kind of salty and not my favorite).  Friday the BF and I had 4 drinks, fried calamari, gyoza, 2 sushi rolls and salmon nigiri for $40.  Not bad, not bad at all.  The Biltmore location is where you will find me."
0,"It was family day (the ex and I like to see our son smile) and we were starving... after driving around for a while we pulled up to Arriba's and said ""what the hell...""

That's also what we said when some of the food came, as in ""what the hell is this??""

So positive first.  The server was pretty quick and he gave refills without being asked.  Chips and salsa were good.  Chips were warm and salsa had a nice (suprising) kick.  Kick... do I sound like an old lady? 

Morgan and I ordered fish tacos and beef tacos, respectively, so we could swap one for one.  Fish was ok... nothing spectacular... but honestly I would rather pay for one at freakin Del Taco or Rubios.  Not worth it here.  Rice was ok, some flavor, probably converted rice though.  Beans were... blended?  I dunno about you but I like to see some actual BEANS in my beans!  This stuff was like brown goo... YUMMMMMMMM... :P

The beef taco was just weird.  I swear to God is tasted like gyro meat!  WTF?  I couldn't eat much of it.  

Last but not least, Dom ordered the White Sands Chimichanga.  That sh*t looked nasty to be honest.  Covered with some gooey white sauce, filled with pork.  LOL, he said it tasted like hot dog.  Um, yikes!  He took about 2 bites and was ""full"".  A.K.A., he didn't like it.

I also had a margarita... it was HUGE and didn't taste very good.  I'd rather have one 1/4 that size that tasted nice.  Oh well.

One star for the chips and salsa.  Like I said, the fish taco was okay, but every thing was just way over-priced!  

Final verdict?  We decided to NEVER go there again."

Pretty Nail tale with Tiffany-
My 10 year old first mani/pedi
4:35 water and feet in chair only 13 minutes and painting toes. Prepped and painted fingernails from the chair- in 20 minutes. 35 minutes in all. Told owner I was unhappy and she said that a kid mani/pedii was 35 minutes then later 35 to 45 minutes. Tiffany never let it dry between coats so when she sat her under the light she told her only 5 more minutes and I stopped her. She said only the under coats will be wet and the top will be dry. I told her Really because you never even let it dry between coats.  She said not 4 coat. Base 2 color and top is 4 ... well top and base dry fast she said...Owner said"" fast or slow it doesn't matter as long as the polish looks good and it looks good."" I didn't tip her on purpose...not because I'm poor- I got poor service. I would expect this for a color change but not a spa pedicure/manicure.  Very disappointed.  You'd think the owners would realize that all the other patrons saw her take advantage of us.  Get anyone but Tiffany unless you want a quick job!"
1,Awesome atmosphere and a unique place to go. I ordered the habanero burger and it really lit me up. As I was nearly finished the waiter remembered it is supposed to come with a free glass of milk (which I didn't get).
0,"This was by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I paid $20.00 for a show and dinner. I received the show only because it was from an outside source. The show was 2 hours long and by the time it was over half the restaurant I'd say 50 to 80 people still had not been served. They didn't have enough menu's for people to even order off of. Some guy in shorts walked around with buckets of silverware wiping them on his shorts then placing them on the table. The show started at 7:00, at 9:30 I still had no food. The people who did get food complained that it was terrible. Maybe I should be happy I didn't get any food. When I asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it. The guys in the kitchen were overheard saying ""f---k those people no more orders! not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back. We ended up at Dennys eating eggs at 11:00 . Seriously I've never had such a bad experience in my life. Can you imagine paying for a dinner then being refused the dinner or a refund? unbelievable"
1,I recently stayed at the Sheraton for two nights while attending a conference in Phoenix. I was blown away by the services. This is by far the best service I have received while staying at a hotel in recent years. I received a room on the 15 floor. Room was what you expect from Sheraton. The view from the room really sucked!! I got the room with a view of the hotel satellite and communications towers. TV quality was good and room had Starbucks coffee. Room also came with a refrigerator. I would like to see Sheraton move to Nespresso machines. After a long day attending a conference was great to relax at the hotel lobby bar. The desserts are yummy. I didn't get a chance to try the restaurants in the hotel. Hooters and Starbucks are directly across the street. My work colleague used the gym. He said the pool was really nice and gym had everything you need. Next time!!! I would definitely stay here again!!
1,"So I e-mailed East Maryland the same afternoon as my visit, explaining that I was disappointed that the coupon I had given them was not honored, and they e-mailed me back before the end of the day, apologizing and letting me know that my Visa would be credited the amount of the coupon. 

Then they called today to see how the boys were all doing after their shots, and acknowledged the bill issue again, and hoped that everything had been settled to my satisfaction.

This kind of immediate and friendly follow-up redeemed them and gained them another star."
1,"Went here tonight with a friend and we had a wonderful experience! We decided to start with the calamari which was just ok but I am more partial to the fried versions so that could have been part of the problem it was a little on the rubbery side and wasn't packed full of flavor. The bread that came with it though was absolutely amazing, hands down one of the best breads I have ever had. It also had a mini salad with it that had a wonderful dressing so we focused more on the bread and salad as opposed to the calamari. For dinner I decided to go with the lamb and potatoes which was 3.5/5 stars. It had decent flavor but I definitely have had better. The potatoes were very delicious though :) My friend had the duck and potatoes and it wasn't gamey and fell right off the bone which was great. It had good flavor but once again I have had better. For desert I got the pear/almond pastry(tart? can't remember) and it was absolutely amazing!! Soooo delicious and had a great balance of sweetness and was the perfect size. My friend got the blueberry and lavender desert with red cake and white chocolate which was very good as well and you could taste the lavender which was delicious but overall I don't think I would have been able to eat the entire thing myself as the sweetness level was very high.

This was a very cute restaurant and the staff was wonderful and very helpful. We had a great experience here and are looking forward to returning! I definitely recommend people try this!"
1,"It's about time I write a review for Kona Grill... after all, I've been here more times than I can count and 2 of these times occurred this week alone!  

Kona Grill is a chain which makes me want to give them only 3 stars, but considering their food is quality, they offer a fun atmosphere, and their service is decent... I'm giving 4 stars instead.

As many of the reviews before mine say, happy hour at Kona is great.  From 3 - 7, they offer 1/2 off a small menu of appetizers, sushi rolls, pizzas, and drinks.  (They also have a reverse happy hour from 10pm on I think).  I can't speak for the pizzas (I've never tried them), but the potsticker appetizer is great, and so is the sushi.  If I'm not concerned about happy hour prices, I've often ordered other menu items such as seaweed salad, edamame, nigiri, and the seabass entree too.  I've never been disappointed.

I usually do not choose Kona as a destination, but if I'm in the area, at the mall, or someone else chooses it, I'm happy going to Kona every now and then.  It's good for what it is - take it or leave it!"
0,"It's ok, good for a quick bite. I don't understand the almost cult like following.
Made a mistake and had the shake instead of pop and was sick for hours.
Staff was very friendly, but they needed someone dedicated to keeping the place clean."
0,"I wasn't feeling RnR at all!  We don't usually venture into Scottsdale for many reasons, but the siren song of a non-pretentious late night eatery was just calling to us.  Unfortunately, non-pretentious doesn't apply to the prices.  We came shortly after opening day, so I completely forgive the awful service, the place was packed.  I was irritated though when we were told they were only going to be serving sandwiches and burgers, nothing else, even though we were specifically told that this place would have breakfast all day.  Breakfast is what I wanted.  Oh well.  

We ordered the burger and got some mini corn dogs as an appetizer.  The mini corn dogs left a lot to be desired.  They were served with plain ol' ketchup and plain ol' yellow mustard.  Yuck.  The corn dogs were only okay.  The breading around them was way too bread like and it was just lacking in flavor.  The burger was enormous.  Unfortunately, what it lacked any flavor.  I guess what it lacked in flavor it was clearly making up for in size.  The bacon that came on it was equally huge, roughly 2 inches wide and at least 8 inches long... (that's what she said! Ohhhh!)  Anyway, I was obviously not impressed.  We might come back sometime, because their breakfast really does sound wonderful, but hopefully they've figured out how to efficiently serve a busy restaurant by then."
1,"No question -- my FAVORITE burger in the valley!

I first got turned on to Lobbys at a Yelp Office Hours -- http://www.yelp.com/biz/september-office-hours-at-lobbys-tempe#hrid:kQOElzgklMRbAyWS8LhVFw - - and by my check-ins, you can see i've frequented there since. 

I've tried a lot of other ""great"" burgers -- 5 Guys, Smashburger, etc - but IMHO, none of them stack up to the food and the experience at Lobbys. 

The burgers at Lobbys are so good that I crave them --I want to drive across town or plan out my day so that I'm in the area to get one! I just feel that there's more quality ingredients with a Lobbys burger -- the bun, the taste, the way the cheese melts over the whole patty, the special sauce, and the burger itself. 

And just as Lynn W says the service is truly superior here and "" He (Lobby) really cares about his business and it shows"". 

I've recommended many friends to check out Lobbys and have brought a few friends here -- everyone has loved it! Especially my Chicago friends that live in the valley. 

Lobbys burgers is that raised bar that I measure all other burger joints to."
1,"Need fig preserves? They've got it. Fennel? It's beautifully packed on ice and extremely fresh in the produce department. Need boneless pork loin roast from the blade end? The butcher has your back. Duck fat? Just take a peek in the freezer section. Sometimes, it's the little things that normally go unnoticed that gets you five stars...

AJ's closed early the other night in lieu of the holidays and I ran around to FOUR different stores looking for something as simple as whole grain mustard and fennel. I came up empty handed on both items. I say ""simple"" items - but it's amazing when you rely on a grocer like this as much as I do and realize that most items are out of reach otherwise. AJ's carries practically anything my culinary desires could ask for!

Although I had to wait a day to go shopping again and to make the recipe i was wanted, it was during my adventures to the 4 stores that I realized how much I truly appreciate this grocer. How is it I can get wireless internet via laptop on the I-10 freeway courtesy of my phone company, but can't find fennel within a 10 mile radius?

This my friends, is why I love AJ's. And as someone who watches America's Test Kitchen as though it were food porn, I can say that any other grocer doesn't stand a chance against Eddie Bashas' high end store.

You truly do get what you pay for. For all the employees at AJ's I say ""THANK YOU!!"" for the great service you provide and the products you offer."
1,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here for the first time. I have nothing but good things to say. Food, wait staff and overall experience were excellent. This is an old school type of steakhouse with red velvet wallpaper, leather booths, etc. If you haven't been, I can't recommend it highly enough. Give it a try and you'll be glad you did!"
0,"Traveled for work and we have a corporate agreement with them. I arrived at the hotel and was informed that they did not have my King bed available, I never get how you reserve a room and then they are out. I asked if I could get an upgrade, which they obliged and put me on the executive business floor. The floor smelled of cigarette smoke. The hotel needs some repairs overall, which they said they were going to remodel. Room was clean, some dirt behind the bed, yes I look everywhere and the little closet was in very rough shape. What I was really upset about is that these hotels and our agreement is supposed to have a Sleep Number bed. It's even advertised. Nope, not in the executive floor rooms. Makes sense right? My mattress was worn and not comfortable at all, prob the worst night sleep ever. Was not rested for the big meeting the next day. IAsk for the Sleep number!"
1,"""You smell like smoke.""  That's the greeting I received when coming home from a terrific UYE organized by BBQ lovin' Deb L.  And at that point, if my stuffed self didn't already know it, I knew I had just eaten some damn good food.

Upon arriving, I had a deja vu moment of being there before...a long time ago, sipping a virgin strawberry daiquiri (I told you it was a long time ago), and thinking I was all that.  Yes, it was Bobby McGee's at one time!  So flash forward 25 years, and I'm having a strawberry lemonade ""adult"" beverage, which was quite tasty btw, in the company of 20 fabulous Yelpers!

We were given corn bread pretty quickly, and it was devoured pretty quickly.  A little on the crumbly side, but delicious nonetheless.  Because my husband could not join us, I went with the 2-meat combo (brisket and pulled pork) so there would be some left to take him.  Yeah, that's my story.  I was a happy eater to find I could order my meats sauce free!  The brisket was good, but a little too fatty.  The pork was really good, however; adequately seasoned and smokey.  I tried the spicy sauce on the table, and found it to be just right, just a little kick to it.  For sides, the mac and cheese was creamy and not lacking in sauce.  Yum.  The roasted corn was really really good.  If corn always tasted that good, I would move to Iowa.

Our service was great and they were accommodating for our request for separate checks with a 20% gratuity.  Our service was actually good enough, especially given a party that size, that I tipped extra.  And I did refrain from eating all of my meal, so that I could have a nice lunch the next day when my husband refused my offer of the leftovers.  Only problem was he didn't refuse.  And I went hungry the next day, wishing I had eaten all of my meal when I had the chance."
0,"I have mixed feeling about the W Scottsdale. During the day the pool area is poorly run, but in the evenings the pool turns into a pretty fun nightlife spot.  

Daytime:
The pool is always jam packed with a fairly disgusting crowd and the dudes out number the babes by a 3 to 1 count I'd say. That's no fun. Oh, and by dudes, I mean douche bags. And Babes? More like gross skanks covered in makeup at the pool. Ok, I guess I'm being a hater, but spend a few hours here and you might be kind of disgusted with the scene too. It's just really amateur hour here with the piss poor service and their bad attitudes and obnoxious patrons. The only reason I came was because a friend likes to stay at the W when visiting and he too noted the quality of this place has declined over the years. He has stayed at four different W locations (NY, South Beach, Westwood) and said this one is the ""worst and trashiest"". It took an hour before any waitress came over to ask if we wanted any drinks or food. When started to get service it was always a long wait for our pitcher of margaritas or buckets of beer and food. Speaking of the food, the fries, fish tacos and club sandwich are all great. The grilled cheese, not so much. The first $42 pitcher of margaritas was weak, hardly tasting any alcohol. The second pitcher was stronger. To be fair, the Saturday service was much better.

Nighttime:
Much improved scene, but still not great. There are a lot of out-of-towners since it is a hotel, but still plenty of locals too. I think it's a good mixture. Pants and collared shirts are required, so that usually gets rid of most of the tank top, neck tat wannabes from earlier in the day at the pool.  But really, you are just trading one group of wannabes for another. Man, I'm a hater huh? Oh well, you can handle it. Drinks are overpriced, but this is the W. Be ready to spend lots o' cash.

Rooms:
I've been in a few rooms at this hotel. Each have been nice and clean, but pretty small."
0,"I ate here over the weekend while attending Comicon.  I was actually pretty hungover at the time and desperately needed to plug my gut.  It was between this and a deli I saw a little bit down the way but pizza always, always sounds good so I made my decision.  In my mind, in a fight between a pizza and a sandwich, the pizza would always win because it has the power of molten-hot cheese and pepperoni shields.

Yay:  It was like $6 bucks for a big slice of pizza and a salad and a drink.  That's a really, really good deal.  The salad that I got wasn't like an amazing salad but it had onions on it and croutons and had a strong flavor.  It wasn't bad.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, ""Throw a salad together super quick and cheap,"" and I got that salad, I'd give it a B.

Nay:  The pizza was not so good.  But, you know, it was pizza and pizza is hard to fuck up so it was salvageable.  The big problem was that it was so greasy.  I mean the pizza sweat grease like a fat man's back.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, ""Make me a cheap ass piece of pizza that tastes good,"" I'd give this slice of pizza like a C.  I choked that shit down though and washed it down with salad and raspberry iced tea.

So, you know, the pizza wasn't great, but after I got done eating I felt a lot better.  I had the strength and energy to check out Comicon for the rest of the day.  I geeked out good."
1,"Excellent customer service, super clean, and the food's not bad at all.  Despite the fact that I asked for extra mayo on my sammy, but got NO mayo, was a little annoying.  But, for some reason, something told me to pick up some packets of mayo.  So I was in the clear and my annoyance never gained traction into anything that prevented me from returning.  That, and the sandwich was pretty yummo.  They also give a pickle and a free bag of chips to go with it.

I do not, however, recommend the chocolate chip cookie.  No bueno."
0,"Terrible service--they replaced my phone screen and it broke within 2 wks. Phone was not dropped or mishandled, just cracked and ""owner"" would not honor their warranty. They only accept cash--that should be a red flag if you are considering a business like this!"
0,"Westgate has a few more restaurants now but stil need more shops for shopping to come along.  It is starting to build up but slowly.  It was nice to walk around from dinner, but the amount of teenage kids there were a little annoying.  Guess I am not the mommy type!"
1,"Maybe it was the authentic Gospel music in the background, but our ears were filled with a heavenly chorus as we feasted upon the sacred, and until this morning unknown, pairing of chicken and waffles--a combination rivaled by only bread and wine in it's ability to induce a religious experience."

Just went there last week for the first, and last, time.  I read the good reviews, so I was expecting much more.  I am a first generation American; both my parents were German and came over in their 20's.  I lived there for a few years, have eaten German food all my life, and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years.  I really wanted to like this place, as there are not many German establishments around here, but this place was terrible!  We were the only people in the place at 2pm, and still had horrible service.  ???  We were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come, she would forget things we had asked her for.  The waitress didn't understand German, as in the German MENU options, so I ordered from the menu using the English translations, and she was still confused. I had to POINT at the options.  YES, there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu.  The bread was stale, the schnitzel was hard, there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just ...disgusting.  They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides????  I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before, because that is exactly what it tasted like.  Plus, I actually got charged the wrong prices - like lunch salad was 3.50, but showed up on my bill as 5.00, etc.  I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left, disappointed.  Waste of time and money, I will not return.  Maybe at dinner time things are better, but DO NOT EVEN TRY THE LUNCH!  Yuck.
Oh, and the website is outdated- wrong prices and discontinued menu items."
1,"The crew at this location is very good. They're quick, thorough and will address redos without out any hesitation. I usually go with the Ultimate Package during the gentlemen's day special for $15 bucks. This package is the best deal  (Wednesdays for the guys) with a full wash, super coat,  extra hand dry, interior/trunk vacuum, interior/exterior windows, full interior and tire dressing plus air freshener of choice.  I've only experienced top notch service here and I've been pleased with the job these guys do."
1,"Found the Tuck Shop on my Urban Spoon AP and what a grand surprise it ended up being!  
In the heart of Coronado this little house has been transformed to a true Phoenix jewel!
The food was amazing..we had pork with a pasta and broccoli.  The pork had two amazing sauces that my boyfriend I argued over which was the better.  The pasta was okay a bit of a cumin flavor but great once we mixed it with the pork's sauce.  The broccoli was a great fresh touch.  
The manager came over and spent some time talking to us more about the menu and plans to open another place with a different menu soon.  A must try if you are a down town kinda person!  
The crowd  was a mix of tshirts casual to formal and the patrons ages ranged just as much.  The menu changes with the season so go check it out!  Only complaint I've heard from people I've recommended was the lack of choice if you are a vegetarian."
1,"Really good barbeque and steaks in an old school setting decorated with baseball memorabilia. The service was tight also which is always a big plus. The food is definitely artery clogging, so i'd reccomend it only once-in-awhile. 

They have some great price points in here modest wine list. Oaky cabernet sauvignon for beef and go for a zinfandel for the barbeque. For the prices, you can't go wrong!"
0,"I have lived here for about 5 months, the place is okay i guess, the ground are clean which I like, but the staff seems kinda disorganized.. they got our move in dates wrong which thank god I'm an early mover and didn't wait to the last min, then when we FINALLY moved in, we got a different apt than we were showed originally. The linen closet has a big freakin heater tank in it. Which okay whatever i guess is not that big of a deal but then I found out we pay more for our water because its not divided out between everyone else. Also EVERYTHING breaks our shower has broken twice, the closet light broke out the wall, the bathroom light fell out of the wall, the kitchen stove and the washer has all broke from the time we moved in (Last May). the only reason i give it 2 stars is because i do know there are a lot worse apartments out there but still my house is falling apart! When I go in the office i feel they always try and rush me out because i can finish my questions its really annoying. So be careful when looking at these apartments when looking for a place to live."
0,"This is my second time trying this place. My first time was a week after they opened and the pulled pork was very fatty and greasy and the fries were awful. I figured now that they had sometime to work out the kinks I would try it again. 

I ordered the deviled eggs to start these were pretty good, I would order them again.

I then ordered The Southwest sandwich. The bun was rock hard and just crumbled so I just took it off. The sandwich was supposed to come with a spicy chipotle ranch that I never got. 

I ordered a side of mac and cheese and it was cold in spots. When my server finally came to check on and acknowledge me after dropping off my food, I asked her if the kitchen could just heat it up a little. This took over ten minutes.

Without my asking they comped my $4 the price of the macaroni. 

All in all the service was pretty lousy, especially when the server only has three other tables and there is more than enough staff on. The food was not worth the price. I don't think I will be going back.
I will however continue to go to Copper Star which I love."
1,LOVE IT! Food & Service always great!
1,"What a great way to spend Easter morning!

After taking part in the egg hunt on the main grounds (and BTW, they know how to do it here: Massive dumps of eggs full of goodies. More than the kids could carry. Plenty of photo ops. Parents who weren't acting out scenes from Soylent Green.) we made our way to this nicely upscale coffee shop/casual dining spot. 

We were seated 30 minutes ahead of our reservation, keeping my little guy from popping a gasket. I chose the $19 breakfast buffet, and considering it included a custom-made omelette with organic ingredients--as well as juice and coffee--it was a steal. 

Service was wonderful and the staff was sure to make us feel at home. Well, actually better than home because I don't have people looking after my every whim and need while at home."
1,"I absolutely love the food here!  The sushi and Walnut Shrimp are cravings that I must give in to.  This is a nice, small restaurant that is exceptionally clean and comfortable. Good for a casual date, lunch any day (their specials are a great deal), and the owner managers are on site most hours they are open. 
You have to try the Walnut Shrimp!"
1,Great food and very friendly service.  Happy to recommend!
1,"Whenever my brother is in town he always stays here so when the hubby & I were looking for a place to get away for a night we stayed here. We are the not the party crowd which is why we chose to stay here on a Tuesday after a holiday weekend. Here is my take on Hotel Valley Ho: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.

Good:
1) Gigantic, comfy bed. I slept like a queen.
2) Private balcony with large chaise lounge and sitting area.
3) Outstanding bathroom. The tub is separate from the shower which is and the toliet has a room all to itself.
4) Cool decor both interior and exterior. 

Bad:
1) Bed pillows were too squishy. 
2) Toliet paper/bath tissue was surprisingly rough. I would expect a hotel of this caliber to have a softer tissue.
3) The mini bar and console are fully stocked with an assortment of spirits, but no coffee or tea. Not everyone that stays here drinks his/herself into a stupor.

Ugly:
1) Parking is $15 per day, but you have the option to self park which doesn't cost a thing so I guess that's not really ""ugly"".

Overall, we had a lovely stay at Hotel Valley Ho and look forward to our next visit."
1,"Having recently moved from the Bay Area, I had ignorantly thought that there wouldn't be any decent ethnic, especially asian ethnic, food. Thankfully, I am completely wrong! Elephant Thai is a good thai place with a varied menu, freshly made food, and nice atmosphere. An added plus to the Tempe location was that they allowed us to bring our small pooch to the patio area where we dined. We did have the corn cakes, which were ok. I don't remember them being bad or great...but my husband likes corn a lot, and I think he enjoyed them more than me. The green papaya salad was as close  in flavor to the papaya salad we had freshly made for us on the beaches of Thailand as I'd expect around here. We also had the thom ka soup which was really tasty. It was a while ago, so I can't remember the entrees we got. I probably got the pad thai...just to try it, and some kind of meat dish. I definitely don't remember anything being awful...and although it might not have been exceptional food, it was enjoyable. Thai ice tea was yummy, and my husband had the limeade which was too tart for me, although he thought it was really sweet and quite good. I do remember that for 2 people, what we ordered was a huge amount of food that we had no chance of finishing, and yet the final bill was quite reasonable. 

We weren't able to order any dessert, but I did notice that they had the sticky rice w/ mango on the menu. It probably wasn't in season anyways, but I will definitely be ordering that at some point. This will definitely be one of our go to thai places."
1,"Still loving Sunflower after a year and a half.  I actually moved houses to be closer to this grocery store.  The staff have never complained about going an extra mile, the prices have stayed better than any store I've been to lately and they have been having great beer specials.

Special note:  They have a large selection of homeopathic and environmentally sound products for your everyday corporal adjustments.  Tons of specialty soaps, herbal supplements and vitamins.  Check for the solution here before going to chain pharmacies!"
1,"Teresa S. and I were one of the lucky ones to win tickets to see Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci last night at the Symphony Hall, and we were impressed with the acoustics. The overall sound quality of the live act was fantastic, so overall I'd say that the gig was pretty amazing.

It's a fabulous hub of culture, but the food concessions need some urgent attention. The only munchies they have are desserts like cookies or pies, so be sure to have dinner first.

One of the great things they offer is you can now pre-reserve your intermission drinks.

You can pre-order your favorite libation before the show, and they will have them ready on the refreshment table. 
That would save you time in case you need to whiz to the loo, and not have to wait in line again to buy your drinks.

Thank you again to Yelp and Arizona Opera. The show was wonderful."
1,While we were in Mesa AZ for a holiday we found Alessia's on Yelp and we are so glad we did. The food was delicious and the host was terrific as were the servers. We are not big wine drinkers but they have a very good selection of wines and the host knows his stuff and can make good recommendations. Nicely appointed little restaurant with a great menu.
1,"Beautiful country setting in Phoenix on an old farm. Watch closely because it is easy to miss as it is actually an old farm near the Legacy Golf resort at South Mountain. 
Very good home made breakfast with fresh ingredients from the farm. 
Orange juice was fresh and tasty. 
Eggs and bacon were very good. Biscuits and gravy were excellent. 
The setting was the star of this breakfast!
I would recommend ! You won't be sorry !"
0,This was the second time I placed an order over the phone that was delayed over an hour. I was told over the phone that it was going to be only 15-20 min for me to pick it up. I showed up 30 min later and my order was still delayed. I ended waiting for another half of hour to receive my order. The pick up service was the worse I have ever experienced.
0,"Qdoba is a kicked up version of Chipotle/Kokopellis.  You walk up, choose a form of delivery (burrito, nachos, salad, burrito bowl, etc) you get a choice of meat (chicken, steak, etc) then you chose your toppings (different salsas, lettuce, cheese).  We all know the drill.  I will say one thing Qdoba is much better in taste than Kokopellis and Chipotle."
1,"Everything about Coronado Cafe is charming and scrumptious.  It's my go-to place when I want to have a nice, but not fussy, lunch with a friend.  The menu has a lot of variety but not so much that it's overwhelming.  I've never been disappointed by the food.  The raspberry iced tea is delicious too! I like that they don't have any fried food, though my male friends don't so much appreciate that as they prefer fries with their burgers.  

Conversations can be challenging when dining inside-- the acoustics in an old house aren't the best to begin with, and then you cram it full of people and it gets a little noisy.  If you can't tune it out, the patio is a really lovely alternative. 

All in all, you really can't go wrong here!"
1,"I think this is the best frozen yogurt I've ever had. Even better than Golden Spoon, which is saying a lot cuz I love that place. I tried the peanut butter, triple chocolate (not my personal fav but my coworker loved it), cake batter (to die for), strawberry (tastes like a strawberry malt), snickerdoodle, and prailine. They have the best toppings of any yogurt shops I've visited. Favorites include choc chip cookie dough, mini gummi bears, mochi, yogurt chips, cheesecake, and boba... not to overlook the fresh fruit...."
1,The oatmeal cookie frozen yogurt here is amazing.  The place is small but accomodating enough to get your yogurt and find a seat.  It's similar to Yogurtini and the other places like this.  Last time I came here I saw a guy with the most awesome 80s blonde mullet I have ever laid eyes on. Rock on.
1,"Brand spankin' new...customer service with a smile.

Good selection, good prices, friendly customer service. Bought some stuff to make the house better - garage door opener, some hooks to finally hang that darn 65 x 78 painting up...

Nothing at all like Home Depot, either. I found the fixtures for kitchen improvements here to be of higher quality as well.

Thumbs up from me...plus, it's so close to the house - not sure if that's a good or a bad thing. Time will tell."
0,Like watching a train wreck in slow motion will definitely be going somewhere else for bagels from now on disappointing have been going there for years.  The eight day old cream cheese was a nice touch (yuck!)
1,Yay!! This place is fantastic. Great pastries and atmosphere. I can't wait to go back.
1,"Green is pretty tasty with high marks for the strawberry soy shake. I do agree with the poster below that some items are hit/miss. My ""Artichoke dip"" was way WAY too spicy (I could not eat it). My 'eggless eggrolss"" were tasty but ..fluffy. They came with a sauce that i enjoyed. 
This is one of the essential places for Veg food in the Phoenix area."
1,"I recommend this to everyone.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Inexpensive, great service, off the beaten path. Love this place."
0,"We tried this out last night. We won't be back. 

There is no indication when you walk in that it's a seat-yourself restaurant. We stood like idiots at the hostess area until somone asked us if we needed something. 

We sat ourselves, and then sat and sat and sat because there was no server assigned to us. Perhaps that is a reason to seat patrons, so a server knows they've arrived?

Finally, the hostess asked us if anyone had helped us, and she was very polite and took our order. 

Our drinks came out fairly quickly, but then we waited and waited for our food. This would have been understandable if the placed had been packed, but it wasn't. It was maybe 75% full (7:30 on Saturday) and there seemed to be plenty of servers. There was one large party on the patio.

I ordered the vegetarian salad (can't remember what it was called) that advertised avocado, jicama, beans, and other yummy things. When it arrived, there was a tiny little mushy sliver of avocado perched on top, and no more to be found. It was as if someone scraped up the dregs of an avocado from the rind of an empty one and flung it on my salad. It would have been more forgiveable if they had just forgotten it altogether. Also, the white beans were undercooked. 

The pizzas were good. I ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese, and it came loaded with summer squash, roasted carrots, olives (local? Hmm...), leeks, roasted onions, and the crust was thin and crispy. My husband also enjoyed his pizza. 

I should actually grant an additional half star to the hostess/waitress, who comped my salad when I complained about it. I was willing to pay for it, but she offered to take it off the bill. 

The final nail in the coffin was perhaps not the fault of the restaurant, but the large party out on the patio had 3-4 elementary-age kids literally running laps through the restaurant for the first 15-20 minutes we were there. If ignorant parents are content to let their hellions ruin other diners' experiences, then I'm afraid it's left to the restaruant to politely and discreetely ask the parents to please reign them in. No such luck. 

Anyway, this place has some things to work on. Fortunately for us, there are too many other great businesses nearby for us to give it a second chance."
0,"Not impressed and probably won't be back. I came for lunch and was immediately turned off by the lighting and dÃ©cor. I sat down and began to peruse the menu when I saw ""Ask server for bento box selection"". I asked the server and he looked at me as though I had grown a third eye. He told me they didn't have bento boxes.. I showed him the menu to which he said ""hmff that's weird"". 

None of the lunch items on the menu struck my fancy so I ordered the lunch special. I got the chicken katsu, it was over fried, hard and dry. The accompanying mammas roll had an overwhelming mayo flavor. And guess what? It came in a bento box. 

There are a ton of great sushi spots in this area so Shogun really needs to step it up to be in line with their competition. (Thank God for Yasu's!)"
1,"My hubby and I have been fans of Roy's since our first time at the flagship location on Oahu . . . and we've watched him expand to the mainland. Our experience with the mainland Roy's have been hit and miss, but the Marriott Desert Ridge location pretty much knocks it out of the park! We went at the tail end of Arizona Restaurant Week. We really liked the menu options for this special week, and the warm chocolate souffle cake is always out of this world . . . If that was the only thing that tasted good, then we would feel we got our money's worth . . . but we didn't have to worry about it because everything was perfect from beginning to end.

We had an adorable server who had a great personality and excellent people skills. She was unassuming and let us linger between courses. As I am a stickler about food coming out too soon after just finishing one course, this was just perfect! And so relaxing. The ambiance on the patio, which is where we chose to sit, almost felt as if we were on one of the islands, not in the middle of the desert . . . with the tiki torches lit and the sound of the babbling water features throughout the resort, it came pretty close . . . it was just missing the trade winds.  The resort had a band playing as well . . . they were pretty good, a few ups and downs. I would have loved if the music was a little more subtle than the pop-jazz mix they were playing . . . oh, but I have digressed. 

My hubby and his daughter chose the restaurant week menu. Hubby had the Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs Smoked & Glazed in Roy's Original Mongolian Sauce. A bit cliche, but they were finger lickin' good! My step-daughter and I shared the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi Beurre Blanc -- it was huge and almost a meal. The rolls were fresh, crunchy, and had a little kick . . . not too spicy. It was a good thing I agreed to help her with it! For entrees, my hubby had the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi with Spicy Soy Mustard Butter Sauce. It, too, was an ample portion of tender ahi that was complimented by the sauce but no overpowered by it. My step-daughter had the Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi with Maine Lobster Essence. Another nice portion of perfectly cooked Mahi.  We all were starting to feel the aloha spirit . . . I had to be the exception by ordering off the regular menu and chose my most favorite entree of all . . . the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish . . . Aah, what a delight, so melt-in-your-mouth delicate . . . I was in island heaven.

Desserts were total home runs -- the melting hot chocolate souffle is mandatory for any chocolate lover. In fact, it tastes the same at every Roy's we've been to . . . it never disappoints. A total surprise . . . and a delightful one . . . was the chocolate coconut cheesecake which came with a side of mango sorbet . . . or did she say it was pineapple sorbet . . . whatever . . . it was the perfect accompaniment to the light and fluffy cheesecake.

We also ordered a bottle of Newton claret which was a modestly priced wine and as my husband said as he swirled and sipped it . . . ""I know my wines . . . "" Having to always be the exception, I ordered the he Original Hawaiian Martini, which was what I considered my dessert. It was a juicy combination of Maui pineapple, vodka and coconut rumMMMMM!

It was truly a beautiful evening from start to finish. You may be asking why I didn't give it five stars then if there were no misfires . . . that five star is reserved for Roy's Hawaiian restaurants that really do create the aloha experience with some special touches only that can only be enjoyed there!"
1,"Awesome carne asada, veggie taco and just about everything else.  Delicious and very easy on my wallet."
0,"My husband and I went to Ernie's a few weeks ago on a Saturday night because it is within walking distance to our house and there is always a crowd so we wanted to check it out. We met our friends in the bar and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. Still no-one offered to take our drink order. 

The bartenders and barbacks made eye contact but no-one came near us. We don't look like hooligans or ruffians or anything so it was irritating. The weird thing was there were people eating in the booths around us, and one or two other people at the bar (who had drinks.) We finally got up and left. Why waste money on places that won't take it! I won't return and will recommend my friends don't either!"
1,"Surprisingly authentic Sichuan cuisine in Phoenix. The staff were very friendly and accommodated our infant without any problem. The mapo doufu had great spice to it. The garlic eggplant (yuxiang qiezi) had excellent flavor and we also highly recommend the twice cooked pork (hui guo rou) and fried green beans (ganbian sijidou). The prices are certainly reasonable for the size and quality of the food. The open kitchen is also a nice touch as it gives kids something fun to stare at (flames shoot up from the dishes being cooked every few minutes). Admittedly, we only went because out POS airline put us up at the residence inn across the street after we missed a connecting flight, however, if we go back to Phoenix or if we lived in Phoenix, we'd definitely go to Szechwan Palace again."
1,"I love this quiet location right of I-10.  Their selection is exactly as reported online, and the online orders I placed are always ready for pickup when they are supposed to be.  Parking is wide open, service is good, and the area isn't overpopulated yet so it's always relatively quiet here."
1,"In my opinion, this is one of the best restaurants on and/or near Baseline Rd in Tempe.

Their service is great! You will be greeted from the time that you step a foot through their door. Unfortunately, per today's so-called standards this is not a very common courtesy. 

If you a first time customer or a returning customer, you can ask the person behind a counter to recommend a meal for you or you can ask for a minute or five. As a very indecisive person when it comes to choosing an item from a menu... I really, REALLY appreciate it when I do not feel rushed when it comes to making such an important decision in my overwhelmed life. :P

I haven't tried too many things from their menu because I usually stick to my favorite: Award Winning Gyro Lunch/ Dinner. A plate of delicious slices of beef and lamb, carved off the rotisserie, served with fresh toasted pita.

Lunch is served with your choice of the sides... Oh, and did I mentioned that their prices are extremely affordable! $5-$13 price range!!

So, enjoy your meal and make sure that you do get a chance to turn around as you are walking out because they WILL thank you for coming!

Kudos to you... my dear My Big Fat Greek Express owners and employees for making my oh-so-many dining experiences pleasant! I shall forever cherish thee!!"
1,Man the chompie sliders is the bomb.  Wish there were some in LA.  Man taste so good and flavor.
0,"A group of us were there for drinks late Saturday night, the bar is really cool, well thought out and decorated. Drink menu, cocktails and draft beers are all exceptional. Only challenge was it was almost impossible to get the attention of the bar staff, I am not sure that since we were a large group and had a tab running that only one batman could serve us but it was really frustrating having bar staff just ignore us! Other wise the place is great........"
1,"What a menu! My boyfriend loves sushi and I don't eat seafood, so going to these types of restaurants can be quite disappointing. However this place has the most extensive menu I've seen at a Japanese restaurant that is known as a sushi bar. The ambiance in the place is really romantic at night with dim lighting, nice music, and delicate plating. All the little details in the decor, like placing the chopsticks on a polished river rock was beautiful. Their menu offered everything from chicken and beef to lots of seafood. I ordered chicken teriyaki and it was delish. Their sauce tasted homemade and was lighter then most which I loved. It came plated nicely. I also had their tempura which was light and airy as it should be. The dipping sauce, also heavenly. My man seemed to enjoy his sushi and it looked nice as well. Overall it's pricey compared to other sushi places, however the ambiance of the restaurant and upscale choices on the menu make it worth it."
0,"Food is always great! Tootsy Maki is always awesome. The music is always great. But the service... The service could be so much better. I came here with my daugther, sister, and some co-workers. I had surgery that restricted me to a certain type of drink. The waiter said I had to throw my drink away do to health code. I was fine with that so I put my bottle in my purse. I asked for water so I could add my protein powder in the water provided.  I was mid way finished with my drink and instead of her asking could she refill she reached across the table and refilled my protein powdered water with lemon water. WTF? Also the booth we were in smelled funky, like dish water... eeek! I will still come for the Tootsy Makie and Tempura Shrimp but I will make sure I always sit outside."
0,"I purchased a pair of Naot Paris sandals ($160 with tax) at The Shoe Mill.  I considered buying on-line, but decided to shop locally instead.  I ended up paying more, but assumed that I was paying for the superior service.  I wore my new shoes to work on Friday.  By the end of the day, I had developed blisters on both feet near my toes and my ankles.  I was surprised because I had read many reviews stating how comfortable Naot sandals are and the salesman who helped me confirmed that I was buying the correct size.  Sadly, I took them back to the store the next day.  To my surprise, I was told that The Shoe Mill does not take returns.  I have never tried to return shoes, so it didn't occur to me to ask this question when I made the purchase.  However, as I stated, I expected full service from a high end shoe store.
I will no longer shop at The Shoe Mill.  It's been three days and my feet are still recovering.  It's a constant reminder of how dissatisfied I was with my purchase.  I will definitely shop Zappos next time."
0,"I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayo's really disappointed me last night. When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, ""not too long."" We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began. 

Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours. 

After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time. 

I don't recommend going to Macayos. You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road."
1,"Walking into this place is just plain confusing.  You could tell it used to be something different, but I've got no idea what.  I guess it doesn't matter.  It just sort of looks cheap.  But that's ok.

The food was right on, and I'll be back for more.  Bento Box A?  Yes please.  Small salad with a great ginger-type dressing, some sort of spicy beef, teriyaki chicken, rice, egg roll, some edamame, a few carrots... am I missing anything?  

The service was great, the food even better, and it only set me back about 5 minutes and 8 bucks.  It seems like a sure bet, and close enough to work for a good take out that it will rise toward the top of my list."
0,"The Duce is a disaster. 
As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown. I wanted to love this place. The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service. The parking is atrocious. It's as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food. They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing. 
However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night. We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce. Management needs to wake up. Great concept. Horrific customer service and staff."
1,"Cute decor-who doesn't like IKEA? Attentive service. We ordered a couple beers and the sweet potato tots. I decided on the Ahi burger and the veggie burger, and my sister went with the two sandwiches: PBnJ and the grilled cheese. Everything was delicious!!!! Unfortunately for us we arrived about 30 min prior to happy hour, but we managed to get a couple beers at the $3 happy hour price. 

I've been here once before and since then it looks like they added a few items to the menu. I'll have to go back to try the shrimp po-boy and the red snapper burger!"
1,"Who woulda thunkkkk Scottsdale, AZ would have such amazing soul food??! They surprised the hell outta me!

Coming from someone who regulars Roscoes chicken &waffles... believe me when I say LOLO's is BOMB!!! 

I got the 3chicken combo... w greens, mac&cheese &cornbread.
 
Cornbread.. hands down Roscoes!
Greens... Roscoes
Mac&cheese... LOLOs for suuuree!
Chicken... tied.. they're both really good!

the staff is super friendly!! can't wait to go back when i visit AZ. (="
1,"Absolutely unbelievable!!! This is so worth the drive from Scottsdale to Tempe! But get there early as they close early and run out of food! It's so delicious my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I love French pastries, crepes and desserts! The macaroons melt in your mouth. I will be returning soon!"
0,"Whatza Culvers?  
I drove by this place as it was being built; didn't know what it was, but ""butterburger"" and ""frozen yogurt"" caught my eye..... so I decided to visit it on 2011-05-30 (dine-in).  Looks like it just opened, and it was busy.
Turns out this place is a fast-food chain based out of Wisconsin that I had never heard of before... kind of like a cross between an In-and-Out and a Dairy Queen.  Menu is a bit daunting the first time - a burger or a sandwich?  what side?  smoothies, or regular drinks?  You walk up to the counter, place your order, take your number to your table, and they deliver your order to your table when it's ready.
The burger patties are different... they're about 1/8"" thick and seem pressed/fried.  The buns are nice and soft... ingredients are fresh or properly cooked.  Flavors are there... but it is a different style burger than what we're used to seeing.  I tried the cheese curds; just wish they hadn't breaded/deep-fried them.  I like my curds natural.  A fountain drink completes the ""value basket"" deal.
Their frozen yogurt or ""concrete mix"" sealed the deal.... we tried the banana split (nice) and their ""brownie cookie dough"".  Kinda hard to screw up frozen yogurt!  yum! 
Okay, so I now know what a Culvers is.  It's a good change-of-pace from the other fast food chains.  Not sure I'd go out of my way just to come here (unless I'm really in the mood for it).   I'll have to try other items, but for now, its a 3 star rating."
1,"Alberto was so cute!  He cheerily greeted us and showed us to the bar.  We ordered the bruschetta with wine while we waited for our to-go order to be prepared.  Alberto visited with us briefly to ensure we enjoyed our bruschetta - and we loved our appetizer!  YUM!  Fresh, fresh, fresh tomatoes and bursting with flavor!  It was fun just being a part of the experience at Alberto's!.

Try the desserts!"
1,"I love Taste Of China. I eat here at least once a week. Their menu is pretty big and the prices are small. Also, they are incredibly fast. If order for pick-up, it's ready in 5 minutes. Should I order delivery, it only takes 10-15 for the food to get to my house. My favorite plates are the crab puffs and the General Tso's chicken."
1,Coconut and carrey heaven
1,I had southwest salad.  red velvet cheesecake mmmmmmm
1,Ask for Alex - he is very helpful and knowledgeable with products in the store. He is a young college student and works part time but always has a great attitude and finds the best deals for our family. Thanks Alex!
1,"I was a regular at the Nello's on 48th st and Warner in Awhatukee, so I was pretty interested in trying this location out.  They are all owned individually so I expected it to be a little bit different which it was.  Still good, but I think I like some of the selections of the other Nello's better.  Not that big of a deal because I have already been here twice over the last 2 weeks, but I liked the soup of the day and the panini's they had at the one in Awhatukee.  Still a great place!"
1,"$5 pitchers of Four Peaks brews? That's an awesome happy hour!  Bruschetta is amazing... $13 is a bit much for it, but still super tasty!  Great environment. Happy staff. Killer design and music.  Great location.  Love it!"
0,"Sushi is absolutely nothing to write home about. They have happy hour all day everyday, which is a great way to start your night. The Korean pork tacos are bomb! Great location in Old Town Snottsdale. Love the staff and atmosphere!"
1,"Suede has been around for awhile now. It's no spring chicken. But I still find the place to be a good time, if you can stand the wall-to-wall people and the loooong lines for the bathroom (only the ladies bathroom, of course).  I think the drink prices are normal for a Scottsdale bar and they aren't any higher or lower than what you'll find at Myst, Axis/Radius or Six...strange, don't they all have the same owner??  It's a fun spot to go though and even if you're not feeling it, you can walk right over to Axis or Pussycat and not take much time out of your night to do it since they're right across the street. If it's a good night, Suede plays the best hip hop and rap music to dance to and the floor will be packed.  On a bad night, the DJ is spinning techno crap (I'm not a fan) and my friends and I will go somewhere else for the night.  There is never a cover for girls, although I think there is always one for guys on Friday and Saturday nights.  Guys have to dress up a little too...I think Suede follows the no hat rule and the bouncer may take a look at your shoes too- guys can't wear sandals or sneakers (I think!) So definitely call and get their updated dress code before you head out."
1,"My birthday cake came from Tammie Coe and it was AMAZING. 

It was beautiful decorated with amazing frosting. But it was the inside that won me over. Gooey, decadent chocolate, oh my! It was so rich, I ate half a slice... but it was oh so worth it!"
1,"We live in the neighborhood so were excited to see a new place with a huge range of beers open up.

The decorations are a bit sparse, but we like to sit on the patio or the conversation areas near the bar, which are perfect this time of year. Yucca chips are personal favorites, as is the gnocchi bolognese. Burger wasn't bad, but a burger is just a burger. They're still adjusting their menu it seems, which I expect any place to do for the first few weeks as they settle in.

I really love their commitment to craft beer, especially Arizona beers. $5 pitchers of AZ beer before 5:00 is not only quite a tasty offering, but appeals to my love of all things local.

Give OHSO a try!"
1,"We went to the game against the Milwaukee Brewers on 3/25/10 and had a great time (and not just because the Dodgers won).  We arrived early enough to walk around outside the whole stadium and see the practice fields.  We even saw Tommy Lasorda, himself, outside at a table giving autographs!

Parking was free (sort of; it was included in the price of the tickets), and we were able to park close because we were early.  Traffic leaving was ""typical Frank McCourt"" style, meaning that it could have been better.  Exiting traffic was set up to force us out in the wrong direction, so it was good to have the car's GPS guide us back to the freeway.

We were surprised to see that not all of the food/drink stands were open, but I think they had only sold about 60-70% tickets for that game (Thursday 1:00 game).  There was plenty of berm (grass) seating.  We had splurged for premium seats ($42 each) for the game, and were almost right behind home plate in the seats that had seat cushions and cup holders.  My BF was very pleased with the beer selections (Full Sail and Deschutes, not just the typical Miller and Bud offerings).  They finally brought in Dodger dogs this year - boiled with short buns, nothing special.  I still prefer them grilled.

Stadium staff was all very friendly, esp the beer guy in our section who said my BF looked like some movie star.  On behalf of the concession staff... FRANK, GIVE THEM SOME SHADE!  The beer/food stands outside of the actual buildings only had slatted roofs, so no sun protection at all, and no misters.  The poor people were totally roasting, and that was annoying to see.

One odd thing about the Stadium is that it faces SE, which puts every single seat in the sun during day games.  Wear a hat and bring your sunblock.  Lots of sunblock.

All in all, it was a very nice experience, and we're glad we went to the game and to Camelback Ranch.  Only a 5.5 hour drive from home, we'll probably do it again."
1,"Introduced to D'lish today by a friend. I'd already had breakfast (although the menu looks great, lots of delicious sounding, healthy options) but he suggested a Chai coffee. I don't usually like Chai Tea, but I thought I'd give the Chai coffee a chance based on his recommendation.

When I ordered, the server suggested a ""Sexy Dirty Chai"", which as lurid as it sounds means adding vanilla. The Sexy Dirty Chai Coffee over ice is hands down now my favorite coffee drink. The place is tiny, has a really cool, funky interior and also has a drive thru- a true local gem. The service is friendly and energetic and I plan to start my day here again soon :)"

0,"Rental car review.

118 degrees.  Standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus.  10 minutes go by and I have seen 3 busses leave with out of service signs.  Another 10 minutes pass and no active duty busses.  Finally, a bus!  We have a packed bus and the driver is just standing outside.  5 minutes later he comes back on the bus and we drive 10 miles an hour the whole way to the terminal.

PHX...pay attention.  Business travelers do not appreciate being left in the heat for 20 minutes watching out of service busses pass by."

2 gates upon entrance and exit safe it up so i have no worries that my shelter dog will hit the streets again. 
this dog park is clean, the people are friendly and so are the dogs. finally, a place where we can all get along."
1,"Sorry, had to deduct a star because it's freakin EXPENSIVE for lawn seats. Really Glendale? You're gonna charge $13 for lawn seats? 

It's a BEAUTIFUL facility! Plenty of grass, plenty of seats, plenty of shade, and a plethora of food choices... all which perfectly align with the baseball experience."
1,This is a great staple of Tempe.  I try to stop by here before spring training and Diamondback games.  If you're looking for a grill dog I would say this is the place to go.
1,"I've been coming to this place semi-regularly since they opened, and I love the drinks and service.  You always get a friendly welcome and the staff is eager to explain the menu.

I'm a chocolate-lover so I usually order a Frozen Hot Koko with almond flavoring...SOO  GOOD!!!

The only thing keeping it from 5 stars are the prices.  Like most places, prices are set so that the large is the best value, but a pair of larges for me and the gf runs about $20, so we only go a few times a year.  Still they have a few ways to save- a loyalty card program and loyalty tiki cups."
1,Food is outstanding! Rebecca rocks!!!!!!
1,"Great sandwiches at reasonable prices. The bread is good, the au jus was flavorful and not too salty, and the sausages are made daily.  It was nice to find a place to get great sandwiches. The line moves a little slow, but it's definitely worth the wait. I had the italian beef and my friend had the sausage, both were great."
0,"Dear Yelp: Why can't there be a 3.5 star rating?  I wanted to give this place 4 stars, but will have to wait for another visit to bump it up.

I have never been here before, so I consulted with my fellow Yelpers for their input.  

The service was quick and prompt.  Our waitress was friendly and on top of things.  I was impressed by the selection of beer, although small, with an offering of Alaskan Amber Ale...mmmm.

We decided to keep things simple this trip.  12 wings, medium flavor, one large margherita pizza with garlic on 1/2.  

GOODS: I LOVE the mozzarella that they use!  I have never tasted cheese this cheesy or this good on my pizza.  NO JOKE.  The wing sauce was also delicious and they provided you with a perfect amount of sauce to cover the wings.  AND, the ranch was NOT watered down, which I am traditionally used to.

BADS:  The parking lot sucks.  We had to park across the street from their main lot to find a spot.  Also, the tomatoes on the pizza were unripe.  Our pizza was soggy in the center, perhaps from the tomato juice during the cooking process, and it made for bad leftovers in the microwave the next day.

So, with the combination of the both, I will definitely say that I shall return to give them another sampling in due time, and perhaps bump up that star to where I think it should be in the back of my mind."
1,"Stayed here one night while traveling to Phoenix for business.  What a cool hotel!  I've never stayed anywhere like this.

I didn't experience the 50's personally, but this place has really kept and captured that essence.  (And yes, it's been renovated.  This place was built in the 50's but it's not run down or anything like that.)

The room was nice, the pool looked great (never got to go...), the service was impeccable, the food at Zuzu was very good.  Old town Scottsdale is right around the corner, with great restaurants and bars.  What's not to like?"
1,"The best burgers in town at a fast food restaurant. Cajun fries are tasty too. They have the coolest soda dispenser at this location. Hey, I never knew they had Orange and Rasberry Diet Coke."
0,"Went with three others. My first & last visit.  The menu did not properly describe the item and instead of a bell pepper dish, I got a port dish. It was dreadful. The other three I went with were not very happy with their meals either.  The restaurant was extremely noisy. Not pleasant at all & terrible food. Will never go back.  A big disappointment.  They can't even describe their items properly so you never know what you are going to end up with. They called it a pepper dish and it was a pork dish. The sauce apparently contained pulverized peppers. Are they stupid?  I should have trusted my instincts & not the commercial.  It's a third world country. They can barely afford to feed themselves. They have no history of cuisine.  I wouldn't waste my time and money on this place again."
1,"I lived off Salazar Bros my first year of college because I lived right near it.  Must have eaten there twice a week minimum.  I was heartbroken when it turned into Armando Bros because as much as people told me they just changed their name, they didn't.  It was a different restaurant.  

I had written it off as another great place gone to the pages of history until I moved near 48th and Baseline, and 'lo and behold there was Salazar's, tucked away in the Fry's parking lot next to a Little Caesars and a clothing outlet that appears to have escaped from the mall.  

The interior itself is cheaply thrown together and completely forgettable.  The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food.  And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices.

I recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and 2 things of red sauce.  It's pork brushed with a delicious sauce of some sort.  Comes with pico and guacamole.  I sometimes have to convince myself to try something new off the menu.  Brownie points for carrying Pepsi products as well, I take Mountain Dew with my burritos."
0,Maybe I expected too much. The silverware was plastic. The plates were plastic. I felt like I was at a cookout.
1,"This is such a beautiful stadium to go to and relax at, everything is so close that it only take 10-15 mins to get where you want to be, and on top of that, there is westgate shopping center that is right there with all the bars and night clubs to go to after the games. I recommend UOPX Stadium over any other in the valley because its clean and any seat in the house is a great one.!!!!Plus the weather is always great!!"
1,"After paying $10 for a footlong Tuna and a drink at Subway (read the review), I was obligated to find new lunchtime stomping grounds. And I've found one. 

How someone is going to take points for ""ambiance"" in a Chicago style gyro eatery is worth my lolz. But, you're not going to a Chicgo style gyro eatery for ""ambiance"". You're going for good grub, and a bottomless drink cup. This place rocks for what it is. 

The decor is cool. I spent the vast majority of my meal staring at the posterboard sized photos of downtown Chicaga. I was lost and mezmerized at the fine details of the photos. I would bite, and stare. Bite, and stare. 

And there was much to bite on. This pita came STUFFED with succulent, tasty meat. I'm not a tomato fan, so I left those for those who are. My gyro was oozing sauce. I would take a bite, and while enjoying the deliciousness that permeated my over-stuffed mouth, contemplated what to do about the sauce on my fingers. KNOWING that if I dared to open my mouth, I'd be looking at the food I had just started to chew, but understanding that if I did nothing with the sauce it would drip off of my fingers into the basket. Quite the dilemma, I tell you. Bite, and stare.... Ooooh! Look! Fries! Mmmmmmm.... 

I was there at 11:30 on a Thursday, and it was less than crowded. Parking was no issue. 

All of this for less than $7. Yep. I'll take my $3, and give it to the bum on the street. Better than spent at Subway."

1,"This is one of my favorites stores to head to when I need the motivation that comes from new triathlon clothing and accessories. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful, without being intimidating.  

They have a decent selection of women's items that are high quality and come with a high price - so I normally head there when I'm looking for race wear/accessories and go elsewhere for regular workout clothes.   They do have some sale items, and recently I found some great Pearl Izumi tri shorts for half off - woo hoo!


It's great to have stores like this geared towards triathlons!"
0,"I had a hankering for raw fish today and decided to give Moto a try.  Overall I was pleased.

The menu had a wide variety of tempting Asian treats but I was here for fish, so I ordered the sashimi combo with a bowl of Miso.

The soup was a bit odd.  It seemed to be normal Miso soup with some shredded cabbage tossed in.  The cabbage added a texture that I didn't really want but it was easy to eat around it.

The presentation of the sashimi was interesting.  I had a pinwheel of fishy goodness with yellowtail, smoked salmon and tuna.  The fish tasted quite fresh and the portions were generous.

When I need a sushi fix for lunch I'll be returning to Moto."
1,It was great coming to this store. It has a large selection of trendy clothes.  I will come back again.
1,"The Goelet A.C. Beuf Community Center is located on 35th Ave. & Pinnacle Peak Road. This is an awesome community center with several ammenities including: classrooms, a gym/weightroom, indoor track, and dance/exercise room. 

The indoor track is free to walk and is air conditioned - bonus for those walkers who dread the summer heat.  Use of the gym is at a cost - I think around $60 for the year, so it's pretty inexpensive but the gym is pretty small.  

They offer a variety of fitness/dance classes, at a cost, including: aerobics, ballet, belly dance, kickboxing, pilates and yoga + many more.  They also offer specialty education classes including: oil painting, computers and spanish.  I have taken a few of the classes and they are pretty inexpensive and last for a few months at a time - either once or twice weekly. It seems that they offer a lot of classes and activities for kids and seniors as well. 

Other amenities include indoor basketball court, softball fields, soccer field, basketball and volleyball courts, playgrounds, and picnic areas.  

The center is always clean and the staff is incredibly helpful.  If in or close to the neighborhood this is a great community center to have access to."
1,"*3.5 stars*

In the interest of supporting local AZ businesses, my husband and I had dinner here on my b-day (5/13). The first thing I observed is that they have a couple walk-up windows on the southside of the building so you can place your order and get food without having to go inside. Thought that was pretty clever! We arrived close to 8 pm and it was still pretty busy inside, but the line moved quickly. 

The restaurant is set up cafeteria style with a kitschy country look. There is a huge mural on one wall dedicated to farm living and a John Deere tractor with accompanying bric-a-brac on the other side. Once we got through the line, I choose the meat plate with 2 sides...beef brisket and pulled pork for my meats, mac 'n' cheese and beans for my sides. I really wanted to get chicken instead of the pork, but they had unfortunately run out of chicken :( . My hubby got the full slab of pork ribs with sweet cut corn and mac 'n' cheese for his sides. We shared a piece of cornbread and for dessert, split the root beer cake. Happily I received a discount on my meal because it was my birthday (they advertise a ""free"" meal, though it's basically $10 off).

The beef brisket and pulled pork were so good! Tender, juicy, and delicious! Those meats really are the best reason to go Joe's. The beans and mac 'n' cheese were just ok...so far Fleming's beats everyone hands down when it comes to mac 'n' cheese! The cornbread was so-so, tasted like it came from a box, but the honey butter that comes with it made it pretty tasty. Regrettably, my husband's pork ribs were pretty fatty as compared to Lucille's (Tempe Marketplace). The root beer cake was good, but not as delectable as we thought it would be. Maybe we were expecting too much after reading how much fellow Yelpers enjoyed it? Another thing worth mentioning (some others have commented on it too) is how strange the beverage station is. It's smack dab at the front of the line where you get your food so you have to fight your way through the crowd (if there is one) to get a refill. Weird.   

To conclude, Lucille's is still our #1 favorite place for BBQ, but we would still go to Joe's again."
0,"I had such a nice experience here - Classic Chicken - the first time that I really wanted to go back. Second time, onion strings were so greasy I couldn't eat them, burger was okay. Third time, yesterday? Enough to say we wont go back. Ever. 

Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth, he ordered 1/3 lb classic, me the bbq grilled chicken - both with a small soda. Soda was disgusting, flat, watery, gross. Upon the lovely's complaint, the bus boy brought him bottled water. I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair. Gak. We got up and left our food. Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda, we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we 'didn't have a better experience'. Um. A better experience??? Seriously? 15 dollars? 

Ugh."

1,"This is our new post-hockey game hangout.  It helps that it is in the rink and that our usual server Rachel is prompt.  It helps that she is cute also.  We came the first time on one of it's first nights and it wasn't very busy.  The manager let us play the virtual sports game.  It has hockey, football, soccer, baseball, and golf.  We played for free, but it is rather pricey to use.  It was fun, but I don't think it would be worth using your dollars on.  The bar is owned by the same people who own Overeasy in Phoenix.

I have only had the Black Bean Burger so far, but I tell you what.  It is f-ing good!  It has tomato, lettuce, red onion, and avocado.  I don't normally like avocado, but it's creaminess adds to it.  It has just a little bit of spice too. It comes with fries that are good enough.

The bar itself has cool interior and has lots of TVs around the place.  The booths even have their own televisions.  There is a large monitor at the front with a Wii hooked up.  I strained my shoulder after last weeks game bowling and playing ping pong.   

So if you find yourself cheering on the Rubber Mallets, enjoying an ice skating session, or watching someone at a figure skating competition at the Alltel Ice Den, be sure to stop into 18 Degrees for a brew and a bite."

The same lady is always working when I go, and she is very friendly and upbeat. They haven't yet perfected the multi-flavor ratio in one cup, but I'm sure that will improve, and I'm a huge fan of anything with a punch card. So far my favorite gelato spot in the Valley :)"
0,"Just OK.  But like pizza and sex, there really is no bad BBQ.  
I think there is something lost in translation from its Texas roots to AZ.  Gone is the appeal of the gas station dive.  Atmosphere feels a little phony in a pretty, new building.  The biggest problems I have with the food is the overpowering mesquite flavor and mediocre sauces.  The Texas roots explains the loyalty to mesquite, which is understandable and you cant fault them for staying true... but a little hickory or less creosote-tasting smoke would be nice for a non-Texas palette.  The sauces seem a little amateur.  I know Rudy's is no amateur in the business, but I think they settled too soon on their signature sauces - they taste like the first ones I made in my backyard.  If a true amateur (me) can evolve into better sauces, so can Rudys.  Now I need to stop at the new BBQ joint next door to see which one will get my BBQ dollars... stay tuned."
1,"Nice ambiance, nice authentic spicy chinese food.  
As good as you can get here in Arizona;  it aint L.A or San Fran, but does a good job to satisfy the craving for real chinese.
 
Of all the Cofco asian restaurants, this is one of the more presentable ones to bring business clients or a new date, if ambiance is key to scoring positive brownie points.    
 
For some bizarre reason, on the weekends, it is filled with asian-women/white guy couples,    which strikes me as hilarious.  If it wasn't for this,  I would eat there multiple times a week. 
Asian woman orders from real chinese menu;  her white guy orders from chow mein menu.
 
Side note:  Get a grip; asian women check each other out, and  usually not in a nice way--like in a sizing you up-comparing you to herself way--so I usually end up losing my appetite when I catch one of them staring at me (and my man) and whispering to her white guy or her girlfriends about me;  yah, I understand the shit you say about me, asian girls, because I speak your language too, hello!
 
So I compensate for my chinese food cravings by quick carry out.  Works like a charm every time.  I'm happy, my own Cracker is happy.  Owner gets lots of business and is happy. 
 
We all win."

Get there early if you're going on Saturday morning for the game, it fills up quick. All in all, it is was it is. An Ohio bar, watching football, peeps getting sliggity sloppt. Most are still drunk from the night before. Makes for good people watching practice. Make friends with your neighbors when you find a seat. They could be from Ohio and a new person to be ""besties"" with.

It reminds me of sports bars you find everywhere in Glendale, just with a younger crowd."

Most cheap drive through fast food Mexican places are alike. Of course there are slight differences. In this case it wasn't for the better.

We had to drive up to the window to order. The speaker box wasn't working? What was going on there?

I ordered a chicken chimichanga with sour cream & guacamole on the side. The chimi was big, just like I expected it to be. There wasn't much guacamole. I would have liked more. They also put tomatoes in it. That's ok, I'm just mentioning it. All in all this chimi just didn't sit as well as others I've had. Maybe it was the spices they used that were different, I'm not sure.

I also ordered a large horchata. I have definitely had better. It wasn't the worst I've ever had but it needed more cinnamon flavor, that's for sure.

It's cheap, it's easy, it's fast, it's literally right down the street from me. I'd still rather make the drive over to 7th St to my fave 'bertos though. See: http://www.yelp.com/biz/rolbertos-phoenix"
0,"If you just need a roof over your head I suppose this will do. Don't expect things to be easy for you though. I arrived on Friday shortly before 2pm and wanted to check in early. The pregnant woman at the desk (the one that smells like cigarettes and has track-marks up and down her arms) said the room wasn't ready yet, so I left and drove around to take in the sites.

Coming back an hour later (now officially check-in time), I was told that that room STILL wasn't ready. How long does it take to clean a room? You've got 100 other rooms, put me in one of those! She left me standing at the desk while she went out and found a room that was ready. Finally.

This is the first place I've ever stayed that wasn't a converted B&B that had hardwood floors. Hardwood floors are cute when you're staying in somebody's house-turned-hotel, but in an actual motel? I felt like I was staying in a hospital room.

Sparse furnishings include: 12"" TV, 2 hand towels, 1 wash cloth, 1 towel, huge desk that takes up more space than it should, and a scratchy bed. 

Like I said, it's an okay place if you just need a place to sleep."
1,"I love Stax. They introduced me to the world of quinoa. Their quinoa black bean burger is sensational. I do the ""Build your own burger"" and get garlic aioli and the house ketchup. I am a big fan of their sweet potato fries, as well.  The service has always been great and the prices are reasonable. This is a good alternative to Delux, if you are in downtown Scottsdale."
1,"I've been a patient of PFD for a few years, recommended by a friend, and have always been happy with the attention I've gotten. I actually go to the Gilbert location now, but I have been to the Tempe office once and had a good experience there. 

It's a family owned business, I think they've been around for 30 years. They have always been pleasant and honest when talking teeth. I wanted to mention my hygienist specifically, Jackie. She is super nice, calm and gentle, which is important to me since I don't particularly like going to the dentist. 

Check them out if you're in the market for a dentist."
0,"I went here for a business conference.  Granted, I just came back from a REALLY nice place in NYC, but I still expected something amazing since it was called the GRAND RESORT.  I must agree with fellow yelpers that it seemed a bit outdated.  I did not like the rooms.  There was a baby sink and mirror area.  A bazaar bar in the living room that just didn't seem to fit.  The beds were mediocre.  I did enjoy the kid free pool!  I found it very hard to find my way around this damn place!  I got lost several times :)  I did appreciate their concierge service - very helpful.  I needed a sewing kit to fix a button that came off - $7 later, I had one small thing of thread, baby scissors and a needle.  Drinks and food were sky high.  We ended up walking down to a little mexican food restaurant nearby.  I don't think I would go back..."
1,Yep -- still my favorite hole-in-the-wall eatery awesomeness. The brisket sandwich with cheddar and slaw and dippin' sauce was to die for. I ate at the bar and just enjoyed my visit.  Can't wait til I can walk here!
0,"We made the trek down from northern phoenix to get some authentic ramen.  I wanted to love this place and I wanted it to be worth the trip, but it just wasn't.  The decor is as previously described - you sort of time warp back to the 80's but it is clean and well loved by its owner.  They do have a lot of authentic menu items and a great kids meal, but the ramen was just not that good.  Its downfall was the broth.  Hubby got the salmon chirashi which was also not that fresh.  If I'm in the area, I may give it another try for the don-buris."
0,"went midweek and were seated right away

Table was clean, service was adequate but food, meh.
Hasbrowns barely cooked and no flavor and the famous biscuits were more like mini loaves of bread with no biscuit consistency and the gravy was honestly just blah.  After hearing such rave reviews I had to try it once but don't need to go back.  Kinda sad because I love breakfast."
1,"Love this place! I went with my Grandma and Aunt on a Thursday afternoon. The weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside. First I like the layout of this place, very open and airy. There are 2 outside patios one street level and then one upstairs. I actually have been here twice so far. First time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists. The servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka, grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend. 
The second time we ordered 3 small plates to share, ahi tacos, artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels. All three were heavenly and very reasonably priced. The ahi was fresh and chilled, perfect for a warm day. The artichoke dip was different than any I have had before, gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl. The chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted, even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips. The mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves. Buttery and melt in your mouth good, not chewy at all with no grit, to most common problem I find. The broth was so good I let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl, soaking up the juice. My martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table. 
Now on to the staff, all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled. All of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server Jennifer. We also met one of the sous chefs, Lennie. A charming fellow with stunning blue eyes, my grandmother remarked on them, a playful Mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform. He swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket. I do believe he is right, cooked to perfection, slightly crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and I believe Parmesan cheese. After our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking. 
RnR is another great place within walking distance from my salon and I am looking forward to trying everything on their menu. If all the items are as wonderful as the first 3 I tried I am in for a treat!"
0,"We've eaten here a few times, and the food was always good.  However, the last time we ate there, I found a BUG in my food.  When we complained to management, they still thought we should pay for 50% of the meal.  Never eating there again."
0,"I hate the heat. HATE. Yet I am doomed to reside in this heat haven so when my best friend raved about a place where you can sit outside in Arizona and not feel the heat I had to check it out. By the time I ventured downtown to glance at this place Phoenix was experiencing a cool down so the patio was very comfortable without the fans and misters. 

Our waitress was great and even chatted about our night and my favorite bar, SideBar. We got the L.B. favorite lavosh and I okayed the bacon even though it didn't sound too appetizing. It wasn't. I ordered some chicken sandwich that was on a french roll. The salad on the side was better than the sandwich. My friend ordered the classic turkey which was large but average. BUT I think ordering the classic sandwich was a boring mistake of its own. The fries that came with the turkey were greasy and when I ordered a amber ale and some guy brought a pale ale. I like pale ale so it wasn't too bad but it made me yearn for the amber. Yes, or course I ordered the amber next.

The waitress told us that the island bar was opening the next day but there were still ladders and paint cans lying around. I failed to notice until my friend mentioned it. The only really cool thing about this place is that it is in a historic building with strange bathrooms. Other than that I would skip it."
1,"We've eaten at Taneko twice now, and while we like it, it's awful expensive for what you get, and I prefer a more authentic Japanese environment.

Taneko starts off wanting to be a Japanese-style pub restaurant, but ends up throwing way too much Scottsdale into it creating a rather pretentious yet still yummy restaurant.

The food is excellent - I enjoy the pork meal that has the stupidly spicy mustard sauce.  My kid likes the fried rice, though it is a little too much on the ginger side.  There's a gimmicky hot-rock appetizer where you cook pieces of steak on a super hot rock.  It's way too expensive for what little meat you get, but it's an awful lot of fun.

The service is excellent as well, though maybe a little too servile for my tastes.  The wait staff go WAY out of their way to make you comfortable and quickly take care of any needs.  I just don't care for all of the introductions - I'm not going to remember the names of the 4 or 5 people bringing me stuff.  Still, I think that's the Scottsdale influence.  Not bad, but not really my thing.

Overall, I've enjoyed both of the meals that I ate at Taneko, but with better places to eat real Japanese food like Yasu, Sea Saw, Hiro's and even Sakana, I'm probably not going back real soon."
0,"I really wasn't impressed. Came here with some friends to grab some takeout, and nothing really made me smile. The al pastor was 'meh', at best. The carne asada wasn't particularly noteworthy, and though the vampiro was tasty, there wasn't anything hugely redeeming about it. Nothing to write home about.
Sucks, because my friends in Arizona swear by this place. I'm giving it three stars more out of courtesy to them, but my own personal experience here wasn't anything over two. The people who worked here were very friendly...  I've heard that the ceviche is the bomb diggity... I wish I could come back here and give it a better review, because I'm sure that next time would be better, but as it stands right now, I'm just not a huge fan.
Sorry guys!"
1,"Came here with the hubs- and we love the place :)  We were able to eat here for significantly less dinero than you typically spend at any other sushi restaurant.  The food comes by on the conveyer belts and the items are price coded by the color plate they are on.  At the end of your meal you just add up the plates for your total.  Each plate comes with 4-6 pieces of sushi- and they also have salads, desserts, appetizers, etc on the belt.  If you are afraid that the sushi has been on the belt for too long or there is something else that you would like that isn't currently on display you can order direct from the bar.  Win win :)"
1,"I have to admit I was a bit hesitate about staying here after reading some of the previous reviews.  We stayed in the 9000 section of the hotel which is behind the convention center part.  I'd recommend this if you want something quiet where you won't get noise from the front parking area or pools.  Yes, I said pools...a great thing for those of us who only wanted to relax and get some sun.
Every staff member that we encountered walking the property was friendly and always acknowledged us.  
We had a two queen room and the room itself was very large and I liked that every room has either a patio or balcony.  Our view happened to be of the basketball and tennis court but it was nice to be able to go outside and sit on the patio in the morning to have coffee and relax.  I assume that we had a room that had already been renovated since the bedding looked new...and the bed was SO comfortable!  
The breakfast buffet is good and it's nice that you can order eggs anyway you like them as part of that.  Other than that we mostly just had drinks while laying by the pool.  

The only negative thing that comes to mind is the fact that the toilets are VERY loud when flushed.  I have no idea if it was the rooms next to us or above us but every time someone flushed a toilet in the middle of the night I woke up....I am a light sleeper but still, if there are more renovations to be done I hope this is something they can address.

The location is great and I can't wait to book my next trip back."
0,"Margaritas were good, tacos were fair (small), guacamole was wonderful. after ten it gets really loud here. They need to have tequila flights."
1,"Long-time fans of the Mill Ave location...we finally made it out to the original (I think this was the original, anyways).  

Overall, pretty darn good.  

The food is on par with the tempe location.  The pastas were delicious - I really liked the Boa Bowtie pasta.   

Wines were solid and complimented the meal nicely.

As with the Tempe location, the best part for us is always the Shrimp Adriatica appetizer.  We could just eat a big bowl of that with bread.  The sauce is amazing, the shrimp is well cooked.  The only downside was that it was just regular french bread (or similar) - the tempe location has the fancier, tastier varieties of fresh baked bread.  But the quality of shrimp and sauce was the same.  

Service was slow at first (we went late on a Sat night as they were slowing down), but was friendly, made great recommendations and were very helpful overall.  By the end of the meal, I had forgotten about the slow start.  Think we just walked in at an awkward time, which as I said, they really made up for by the end of the meal.  

Also, the warm butter cake was decadent.  Maybe not as good as Mastro's butter cake, but it's on the way there.  Really tasty, very fresh.  I could have used some fresh whipped cream or a little vanilla ice cream to go with it, but that's a personal thing.  

On a side note - the Zinfandel they are currently offering (think it was like $6-7/glass) is fantastic.  I was impressed at the quality compared to the price.  

We'll definitely be back."
0,"The service at this location was great, until one of the servers managed to incorporate throwing up in into a conversation while I was nursing a hangover. Never a good idea to talk throwing up to a customer that is eating.duh!! This conversation led to more inappropriate words from the employee until he finally left....grrrrr!!!

Had the biscuits& gravy special ( $10.95 ), no bueno. I like my gravy simple...just some gravy with a little sausage running through,thats it. Can't stand it when there is onions, peppers, celery, carrot...yuck!! And they served those generic potatoes that are big flavorless cubes that they put in the deep fryer. Should have just had the chicken and waffle, lesson learned."
1,"The food and cocktails at this place are amazing - beyond comparison. I have not eaten one bad thing off of their menu. I am not a margarita person AT ALL but my friend insisted I try their primarita (essentially a skinny margarita) and it was amazing. Probably what all margaritas are supposed to taste like. I crave them.

Their guacamole is phenomenal - fresh and made right in front of you to your taste. You really can't get any better without going to Mexico and eating at at a mom and pop restaurant. The pork shoulder is great and the skirt steak is to die for. This is also a great brunch spot - the green chile chilaquiles are outstanding. 

They are on the pricey end but their entrees are shareable. I love the dark, candlelit ambience. Perfect for pretty much any occasion: date night or bachelorette party. 

Cautions: it seems next to impossible to get a weekend dinner reservation between 6pm and 9:30pm. I don't know if these are blocked out by default on Open Table. Your best bet is to make your reservation well in advance and call them directly. I have never been to this place as a walk-in for dinner. Service has also been hit or miss. I seem to get an excellent server or a really bad one."
1,"girlfriend and i always stop here on our treks to lee lee market.  If you haven't tried pho (pronounced fuh) , this is a great spot.  Basically its a beef soup thats a thousand times tastier than campbells.  its served with a plate of crisp and fresh veggies, like bean sprouts, jalapenos, basil, etc,  that you can throw in the soup.   i recommend using the spicy sauce that has roasted garlic in it instead of sriacha.   we also had the lemongrass beef salad which was equally good.  Everything is fresh and tasty with great service.  

make sure you take dobson for the easiest entrance as pho ao sen is facing west!"
1,"Better like it hot...these folks do not know the meaning of the word ""mild""! Plentiful, tasty Mexican fare at a good price...always a good bet."
1,"I LOVE this place. The marijuana theme isn't kid-friendly though, so DONT bring your kids. Just bring it home to them.

Their subs are really tasty, the theme (for adults) is hilarious, the people are friendly, and are reasonably priced.

Also, the potato salad is fantastic!"
1,"Let's see...what is there NOT to like about Surprise Stadium? Well, $9.50 tall cans of PBR is about all I could come up with and that's not a surprise (pun intended) considering you're attending a sporting event...even spring training. 

But as someone who does not living in Arizona, and as someone who doesn't go to MLB baseball games in Southern California due to the fact it costs so damn much, people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here. Look, you're lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost MLB baseball right in your back yard. If I could, I'd live down here during March just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the Phoenix metro area each year. 

I attended my first spring training game on March 12th, 2012 at Surprise Stadium as the Royals took on the San Francisco Giants (my favorite team). Our seats (Sec. 112, Row J, Seats 13-14-15) were 25 bucks each (around 30 bucks including service fees). I mean, we were maybe 5 or 6 rows back from the Giants dugout (check out some of my pictures). The stadium (funny calling it that since it only holds just over 10,000 people) is big enough so you feel you're at an MLB game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players. The stadium is well maintained and kept super clean. 

Arriving to the park, I was surprised (pun unintended) to see that parking was free, an oddity when going to an event like this. The stadium staff, as mentioned by other reviews, are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful. I didn't have to wait long at the concession stands, even if lines were a bit long. The outfield is lined with a lawn area, perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game (Tickets are around 9 bucks each after service fees!!!). 

I love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family. Oh, Giants won 2-1! Go Giants!!!"
1,"These are simply the BEST sandwiches and salads. If you like your food (a) locally grown; (b) freshly made; (c) organic/all natural; and (d) yummy - and who doesn't? - this is the place for you.

Now, admittedly they have something of a soup-nazi routine set up and if you walk in and don't know the drill, it can be confusing.  So pay attention:   
1.  Look at menu.
2.  Decide what you want.
3.  Wait your turn to order.
4.  Order (give your name).
5.  Wait your turn to be called to pay the other girl for the order you placed.
6.  Pay her.
7.  Wait until your food is ready.
8.  Leave with your food.

Note that there is no place to sit inside - so you can either sit outside, or, (if it is 157 degrees out that day), see if you can find a place to sit over at LUX, they are very welcoming of Pane Bianco diners. 

It's all good."
0,"The queso is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade tortillas are also outstanding.

Aside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!

We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.

We started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it.

We ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions).

Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be ""more than a pile of onions,"" that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.

So much potential, but it fails on almost everything. It's a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...

This time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that ""we're not dirty, it's just the food smell."" Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!

And the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out.

Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future. I'm not sure if our family and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident."
1,"Great Concept!

My girls love this place. You have to really learn the schedule when the place is really busy (because it gets packed) and that is when the experience is diminished and the potential for getting hurt is heightened.

The big plus is the multitude of things to do. For the smaller,. younger children, they have their own set of trampolines and the bounce houses..well, who doesn't love a good bouncy bounce!

The older kids can experience the main attraction and I will tell you that watching some of the stunts is pretty amazing! Not to mention the dodge ball, foam pit and the maze...2 hours gets eaten up pretty quick.

Whats great about this is that kids are being ACTIVE and really getting a work out. I was out for like 10 minutes and my butt was kicked...so this is a great way to get your kids moving and motivated.

The staff is young, but so is the staff at hot dog on stick...but they keep things pretty well under control and I have only seen one person get hurt in all the times that we have been there. Looking for common sense, good customer service, or a straight answer and you might have better luck talking with the floor.

Worth the money...great value...and fun. A definite two thumbs up in my book."
1,I've been going to Orange theory for awhile and I can't believe how much I've toned up and slimmed down!!! I haven't bulked up and now I'm on my way to getting my bikini body back!! I highly recommend this work out!! It's so awesome and I can't believe I can get my full work out in an hour!!!
1,"Congratulations on opening the Gilbert location. Glad to see you guys making the shift to the far East Valley. As to be expected, the bruschetta was great. We really enjoyed the Syrah and the Sangiovese. It's really hard to beat the $5 glass/pitcher deal before 5pm, and the board + bottle ($20) on Monday and Tuesday night make for the perfect date night, though it can prove to create a long wait.

It was nice to see staff from the other locations making the move out here. Small mishaps and things that get confused in the midst of opening a new restaurant are bound to happen. No worries though, we've been 5 times in the first 10 days, showing that you guys are right on target. Looking forward to getting to know the staff and becoming weekly regulars."
1,"Cozy place, great amounts of food for little money, they serve koolaide!!!!  Its all great I loved it both times so far, once in 2003 when I went to review it for the school newspaper, and again 8 years later when I drove by it and the nostalgia made me try it again with the fiance"
1,"Baiz Market is a ""Mediterranean"" type restaurant, or ""Arabic"" type food. Well, you could get confused and call it that. The fact of the matter is though, that this place has a very unique touch. This restaurant is a staple not only for groceries, but also its food. The owner is persian, so you can tell where the tastes are coming from. Its somewhat hidden in the heart of Phoenix, but that's ok, once you are there you will be glad you found it.

This place is unique because they make their own bread! Are you kidding me? I only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago, and I've been living in Phoenix for 20 years. The chicken and beef shawarma have a special, authentic taste because of the fresh bread. One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste, but the pricing is very fair as well. I don't think I can stress this enough, but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area. Why haven't the other restaurants caught on? I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread, but their pricing makes them a different story (I'm talking about 'The Persian Room' in Scottsdale).

I just don't understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away. 'Good bread' and 'Arabic bread' are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives, but they just don't taste fresh.

If you like the bread, head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread, its baked throughout the day, I think. I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation. Beware though, the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days, so you really need to use it quickly. This isn't bad, its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita.

I usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma, but I decided I'd get a kabob plate one day because I also wanted hummus. The beef kabob plate came with hummus, bread, 2 skewers of beef kabob, and some pickles and onions. Wow. The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly, and were EXTREMELY tender. It was a tad bit on the lemony side, but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender. Perhaps some of the best 'persian kabobs' I have ever had. The hummus was definitely good as well, I can't stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus. This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus.

I know friends in Tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma, and rightly so. If you're weary of persian food, just check this place out. Its not expensive at all, food for two is like $15. The wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting."
0,"Beautiful church. My husband and I were registered members and regularly attended mass here. Fr. John Auther gives excellent homilies. The Marian gift shop has beautiful religious gifts. 

We got married at this church, but unfortunately had a bad experience. Communication with church staff was poor and we got little support during the stressful planning time. 

We have since moved to Gilbert, so now we are attending St. Anne's."
1,"This place is the truth. It is easily one of the absolute best spots in Phoenix for Sonoran style Mexican cuisine. The chile colorado is so good, it made me try to slap my mama. The red sauce with the chips is actually brewed in the sixth level of hell. Awesome. Fridays feature $1.99 margaritas before 7 p.m. Swing by, start with the cheese crisp, grab any combo and revel in the gluttony."
0,"I want very badly to love this bar.  I really do.  It has all the promising combinations of qualities I look for in a local locale.  

Great beer.  I have no qualms about ordering the French Canadian Hefeweizen (that I can't even pronounce, spell or at this moment recall) with one glass all to myself and lick my lips at many other brews on the menu.  Add a wine list beyond belief and liquor if its your poison too.

The proximity to my own compound and the blossoming bud that is the central Phoenix renaissance  is always worth a gold star; why commute when staying local is a better option?

The staff and owners of the Sidebar are fantastic.  From my induction many months ago they sling the drinks with pride and the effort in the setup and delivery of the place doesn't go unnoticed. 

The decor is where things start to slide.  Not because the place is hovel, far from it.  Everything is crisp and new.  From the hydraulic bar stools, to the multicolored ambient lighting to the comfy lounge couches, to the super clean bathrooms; this place is a slice of upper crust for those of us who don't normally even thing to nibble from such a decadent pie.  Herein lies the problem or as my former boozing partner visiting from his new digs in Portland put it, ""I'd like to see this place with about 10 years worth of dust on it.""  Not my style, but I dig it and Phoenix sure as hell needs a place like it.

In the end I will go back and don't mind in the slightest having a place like Sidebar to show off to East Valley dwellers and Scottsdale brats, but every time I reach for the front door I pause and am sad.

A mere few feet away lies the corpse of the beloved Emerald Lounge.  A dark, seedy, dirty, smoke filled haven of locals, live music, art and personality that is now nothing but a painted over ghost.  So please, support your local bar, bring your friends and keep the sidebar real.  But remember to pause for a moment of silence and drink one to the ghost below your feet; us locals will thank you."
0,"Okay.....so....I have this thing about going out in Scottsdale in the first place because I'm always like ""that one natural haired black girl"" in a sea of blonde, tan, slim chicas! But that's neither here nor there. 

The Lodge was OKAY in my opinion. For it to be in Scottsdale where everything is super expensive for no reason the drinks are pretty cheap. I had a couple of shots and a drink and spent under $20. The bartender was SUPER sweet and she knew my name by the time I came back for my 3rd drink. 

They have AH-MAZING food deals. Like, get a burger and a beer for $6. Of course it's not a top notch beer but.....who doesn't love burgers and beers??

There is music...coming from somewhere and it's always pretty legit, a good mix. 

There is like an intimate, cabin sort of corner with flickering romance lights when you first walk in if you want privacy but we usually go outside to the deck and people watch and/or play cornhole....Either way, I wouldn't say this is my favorite place ever...but I dont hate it either. 

Plus there is always a line of cabs outside waiting if you are too schwasted to get home :)!"
1,"This is my second time in Chandler for work, and I've been here about four times.  I've basically come here every day during my visits.  It's a great place to have a casual meal and get some more work done.  I like the food and the friendly service, and also refuse to pay for the wireless in my hotel room (even though my employer would reimburse me for it).  Plus, I like the relaxed, community-esque feel of this place.

As for the food, I'd recommend the Tuscan Chicken sandwich - the Ciabatta bread it comes on is really quite delicious, but make sure it's fresh.  salads are simple, but pretty good, and everything tastes fresh.  The chocolate chip cookies are to-die-for.  

The people who work here are very friendly.  One guy was particularly helpful and helped me as I contemplated for about five minutes what I should get.  He then came to check how my food was, even though this is a self-service type of place.  

I would not recommend the half-sandwich half-salad combo if you're really hungry.  Somehow a whole sandwich seemed more filling to me.

Even though I avoid chain restaurants, I really like this one!  Maybe it's because we don't have one in Northern California, so it still makes me feel like this is ""something different""."
0,"I think they need to hire a better chief; the food doesn't taste right.

My mom said she can teach them how to cook for free."
0,"If you're looking for a dining experience at Fry's deli area you're better off going to an actual sit down restaurant.  Fry's ""dining style"" food in the deli area is very substandard at the best."
1,I really enjoy this place for a relaxing dinner.  They really know how to do a great salad and it's defiantly a plus when it's half off bottles of wine night.
1,"This is my go to place when I want a cheap quick meal without having to get fast food. They have healthy options and use fresh flavorful ingredients. Their portion sizes are generous and the staff is always nice and friendly. My favorite is the greek salad w/gryo meat, the dressing is awesome! I'm also a fan of the platters and spanakopita."
1,"I have gone here several times and have tried the pizza, subs and the calzones.  I have not had anything there that I did not like and the only reason I don't give this five stars is because everytime I am in there it seems a large group with lots of young kids has just sat down (or come to run around me while I try to eat) at the same time as my date and I.  I admit, I wish restaurants had sections for families so that those who do not like watching kids run around or spitting food out of their mouths on to the table could eat in peace, but that is just me and that is why I have dogs and not children.

Anyway, this place has awesome food, good service and if you can handle large groups of families then I highly recommend you take the drive out here to give it a try."
1,"Never disappointed with this place!

Get the brisket, get the pork. Get the beans. They're bangin'!!!!!! The sauce is delicious the mac and cheese is pretty good, the cheesy potatoes are good too. The real standouts I would have to say are the brisket and the beans. Do NOT skip the beans. Trust me. 

I'm not even a meat person but I do like Joe's because everything is cooked just right. Order extra of everything and you will be glad you did. Makes for great leftovers. Don't forget to get some BBQ sauce too. Personally, I'm not one to douse everything in BBQ sauce, just a little dip here and there, but the sauces are really good. 

Even my young niece and nephew enjoy the food. It's simple, down-home good food even the pickiest eaters can enjoy. I've never actually dined-in at this place. I've always called in an order for pick up or ordered right at the take-out window. They are pretty fast.

My future father-in-law wants me to choose Joe's to cater our wedding rehearsal dinner. Did I really ever imagine in my wildest princess wedding dreams that I would choose BBQ for my rehearsal dinner? Not really, but Joe's is excellent, and we're heading toward a laid-back wedding theme anyway to take it easy on our many out-of-town family and friends. I am sure they will all love Joe's and I can't wait for them to try it!"
1,"I don't think I've ever been to this place when it's not been crazy busy. It's just a small little eatery, but it's always busy. They have some great food and the peanut butter pie is delicious. Just a place to hang out and enjoy some breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks at. Parking isn't the best and that is a problem, but if you live close and can walk, its ideal."
1,"I love Lux. The new venue is great because there is a lot more room. The only problem is that it's still not enough. This place used to be a great place to just hang and spend the morning on a weekend or weekday. Now it's over crowded and doesn't have that neighborhood feel anymore. Some of the staff is super friendly while others have attitudes. 

The coffee is impeccable and the food is delicious. That first sip of my soy hazelnut latte is always the most delicious and compares to no other coffee. This is what keeps me coming back. 

If you want to sit for a while, make sure you arrive at the right time. And keep in mind the right time is never the same time. You pretty much have to get lucky to find a good spot. I've started getting my coffee to go. Also, they don't open until 7AM. This is when my shift starts, so I can no longer go before work. A great remedy for this was to buy Lux beans and to brew my coffee in a French press each morning. I'm definitely not complaining about the quality. It's still delicious. 

I try to make a visit to Lux at least once a week and will continue to do so...."
1,"I spent almost 2 years searching for a good nail salon in the North Scottsdale area and I will never go anywhere else again.  It is very clean, the girls are very nice, and they always do a really good job on my nails.  They are upfront about their pedicure prices - they hand you a price sheet that tells you exactly what you get for each upgrade - instead of pressuring you into getting something better and then upcharging you.  I think their prices are super reasonable as well.  For the best pedicure and a french gel manicure I pay $70.  I usually make appointments (Sunday mornings are nicely uncrowded), but I've also walked in and been taken fairly quickly.  I love this place and will recommend it to anyone who asks!"
0,They have great specials and if you like dive mexican take out......its ok.....there are much better places that are not a chain.
1,"Matt's Big Breakfast is a wonderful place in the morning to feel the life of downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten there 5 times in the last year and each meal was worth the 10 to 20 minute wait out side on the sidewalk.  

At 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, July 3, my wife Marie and I ventured downtown and decided to have breakfast out.  Matt's was on our mind.  We waited outside only 5 minutes before getting a table by the window next to the kitchen entry.  Busy place, but the service was great.  Quick with the coffee for Marie and ice tea for me.  Marie ordered an omelet with cheese and mushrooms, while I decided on the special, eggs benedict.  We both had the home fries. 

When everything arrived, the meal was very yummy.  Marie, in her delicate way, snarfed down her omelet with a smile.  My eggs benedict was on a fresh English muffin, topped with ham, poached eggs, and a yummy hollandaise sauce.  Calories be damned!

The whole meal cost $22.53 + 4.00 tip.

Yes the place is small and you'll most likely have a short wait for a table, but get over that, because the experience of eating good food prepared by great people is worth your time."
1,"I have been visiting Mrs. White's going on 30 years, but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken, my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation - I almost got cold feet.

Good thing I didn't. The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.

When you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes. 

I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. I'd just come back on another day. 

To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. White's.

I love this place and hope I always will."
1,"I stayed here with a group of friends for a 1/2 marathon that we were all registered in.  The room that I had faced the In and Out burger but I didn't hear anything.  The pool area is small but if you want a bit of sun I think the best place is in the small grassy area behind the HUGE wicker chair.  Grab a lawnchair or toss a towel down and enjoy.  
The biggest complaint I had was that the Bar didn't open until 5 p.m.  Early, I know but it was my weekend!
The room itself was modern and clean. 
The bathroom was nice, and so were the complimentary magazines."
0,"What ever you do don't waste your money here.  I am not the person who likes to send food back, in fact I hate to do it.  I had no choice here, this was by far the worst mexican food I have eaten.  The food has such a horrible after taste.  I not only hated my meal but tried my boyfriends as well and it was still terrible.  The service compares to the food, we waited forvever just for a server to come over and greet us.  I wouldn't even recommend this place to my enemies."
1,"I moved from Philly this past summer and I've searched all over the Valley for a ""GOOD"" Pizza. After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza, I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia! I love the hole in the wall vibe! Just like home :) The sauce is great and super tasty! The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy..It's what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven!! I love it! My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot, but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta, sandwiches and salads. I want to try their Philly Steak next, but for the time being I still make mine at home. 
Every pizza place likes to say its ""New York Style"", but this place really does a NYC pizza. Well the best nyc pizza you're gonna get in AZ, Something about the water."
1,"I really enjoy this course but I am saving the 5 out of 5s for the Troons, Grayhawks and WeKoPas of the world.  Nonetheless, this is a great, very challenging course and you don't have to drive waaaay up north or east of Scottsdale to get there, which is always a great plus.  I remember Golf Digest did a list of Top 25 College Courses and this didn't make it, which I thought was nuts.  My only complaint is that the course isn't really as luxurious as the peak season rate would indicate.  Also, as the other guys who reviewed this mentioned, there is some fantastic ASU swag available in the shop if you are a fan, they probably have every variety you could ever imagine.  Haven't eaten there but Ted's Hot Dogs is close enough that you'd be crazy not to go there after your round."
1,I'm a big fan of their strawberry water and if I'm looking for a better lunch than what I have at home I'll swing by and pick up a salad from here.  They have a good selection- and it's constantly expanding.
0,"Arrived around 5pm one Wednesday evening. The place is not in a nice area of Phoenix, and it looked deserted, and I was going to leave, when I saw a Mercedes and Lexus pull up.  So I thought I'd give it a chance. The prices were somewhat reasonable, I got the Lo-Lo's for $11 (2 waffles, and 3 pieces of fried chicken). The food was tasty for what it was, but I only give it 3 *'s because its just so unhealthy.. kool-aid, waffles, syrup, and fried chicken! This is the kinda a place I may go once a year, but I just feel so guilty!  Not sure what the syrup was, but it certainly wasn't real maple syrup (I'd imagine it is some sugar based creation), and the waffles were dry. The chicken wasn't very moist, it was also a bit on the dry side."
1,I like their chicago dog. It is delicious. I've had good service here because mostly the owners are almost always working and they are real nice. It's only when they are gone that you get the crummy service.
1,"Great Frozen Yogurt. Helpful staff, clean enviroment."
1,"Had to update because we've now tried the pizza! For all the times we have visited we've never tried a pizza (too many other really good options to choose I guess...)

We ordered the Italian Classic (veggies & meat). We ordered it a little well done/crispy and were not disappointed! It was hot, fresh and cooked perfectly! 

Service was great as usual even though they were completely SLAMMED with customers the day before Thanksgiving filing numerous growlers of their pumpkin beer which sold out in less than record time!

We were there again last weekend for the football games and made it in time to order our favorite breakfast items - eggs benedict and the braised pork dish with beans, potatoes, two eggs and fresh warm tortillas.  It was fantastic! This dish, just like many others (possibly ALL others) is plenty for 2 to share. 

Service was exceptional and the crowd fun and rowdy rooting for their teams and AZ won - so there were a lot of happy customers that day!"
1,"Despite all the recent bad reviews of this place, I actually liked it.  The heat inside isn't THAT bad, people.  Yes, it's warmer than the 75 degrees you keep in your house, but it's not the 110 outside.

I went the other night to see A House Divided (which you would like if you like Chevelle and Breaking Benjamin) and it was ROCKIN'. Sound was pretty good.  I like how it's small enough for the band members to see who is standing in the back and terrorize them.

Ladies... one stall in the bathroom.  Be forewarned that there is going to be some drunk chick that will probably go and make a mess in there.  Just plan on not using it as the evening progresses.

All in all... it's a pretty good experience.  I like that those who aren't drinking get to be up front."
1,I had the fruits of the forest flavor and really enjoyed it.  Staff was very helpful.  Will definitely be coming back.
1,"Absolutely loved this place! My fiance and I came across the Arrogant Butcher while we were in Phoenix celebrating my birthday and our engagement. My fiance had found it on yelp and said ""we must go there for lunch one day"" while we were there. We ended up going here for my birthday dinner, after a ""higher end"" establishment couldn't accomodate my gluten allergy. The food, the drinks and the waitstaff were great! It was so good, we went back the next day!"
1,"Beautiful restaurant! Terrrific service! 

Wonderful, fresh and authentic cuisine - what more can I say but don't miss the Carpaccio!"
1,Amazing food and excellent service. LOVED the porcini rubbed delmonico.
0,"Humble Pie is right across from one of my favorite hang-outs, The Main Ingredient. I've seen this place numerous times and one day we saw a Groupon for them, so decided to purchase it and give it a try. 
The place was fairly dead for a Saturday night. I had always seen this place packed when passing by. Maybe we missed the rush? 
The service was nothing special. Our server had no personality and seemed bored. I ordered a pizza with pistachios, parmesan and red onions and my boyfriend ordered some kind of BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza was dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. It wasn't AWFUL, but it wasn't REMARKABLE either. We left unimpressed and don't really have any craving to go back there again. Wish we understood what all the hype is about. Maybe we just ordered the wrong pizzas?"
1,Best chocolate croissants EVER!!!!
1,"Yummmmm .... so authentic 

This is one of the few mom & pop's type of restaurant in N Scottsdale that taste oh so authentic and fantastic 
This is by far my favorite italian restaurant in town, way better than the big chain like Brios (don't get me wrong, they are not bad either)

It is not a fancy place but very cozy. And it does make you feel like you walk into one of the ristorante in Italia .... the owners are 100% italiano and they only use the freshest ingredients ....  I had the best lasagna there, you can taste the texture of the noodle, the creamy-ness of the chess, the meat favor and the freshness of the tomatoes... totally awesome. 
Had tried the seafood linguine there too .... oh so good as well and with plenty of seafood ... definitely 2 thumbs up. 

During winter, make sure you make reservation ahead though .... this place seems to be snowbirds' favorite too"
1,"Having lived in Chicago for most of my life I was more than nervous of what an Arizona pizza experience would be like. For the most part my assumptions were correct - but Grimaldi's is great! We get the margarita pizza and it's amazing. I'm normally a deep dish pizza person but Grimaldi's is slowly winning me over for thin crust. Also, this place has amazing cheesecake - the best I've ever had in a restaurant."
1,"I went there last night with bf to celebrate our anniversary. After pre-yelp, we knew what to expect as to prices, so it wasn't so much of a shocker.

To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasn't too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastro's is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that.  

For main course, I got Ivory Salmon ""Oreganata"", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes ""surpassed expectation."" I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course.

Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge.

Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers' reviews. Total worth it!!!

The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again.

We didn't order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate ""Happy Anniversary"" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasn't very good and it got loud. Didn't see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room. And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of ""expense account"" people though"
1,"Probably go to this location, or the one at Arrowhead, once a month.  Very much a fan and rarely disappointed with each visit.  They usually have coupons online and they take them from your smartphone!  The only gripe I have is that their bananas at breakfast are usually still a little too green to be tasty.  Although the donut muffins make up for it!  Recommended for all meals, but lunch and dinner are usually a little better.  Screw Flanders."
0,"It is with great regret that I give House of Tricks three stars.

I've been here twice.  The first time, friends invited me and the wifey here for dinner.  Seeing the patio, I thought, ""oh, this is really cute.""  Once seated inside, I thought, ""oh, this is really cute.""  Seeing the prices on the dinner menu, I thought, ""oh, this better be really good.""  Long story short, it was okay.  My friend, who had only been here for lunch, apologized for the unexpectedly high prices.  I didn't care too much, I guess.  It was edible.  I'd probably come back for lunch.

Which I did, with co-workers in tow.  The prices at noon were certainly more agreeable and we all looked forward to a pleasant meal.  Suddenly, this gem of an exchange occurred between our waiter and my boss, Debbi:

Debbi:  How large is the quiche?  I weigh 230 pounds, so I'm a big girl.

We giggled.  Debbi loves to joke.

Waiter:  Well, it's not as big as you.

Bad form, dude.  Bad form.  You're lucky we paid lunch menu prices."
1,"This is a great QT for when you're driving through Phoenix on I-17. It's right off the freeway so it's perfect for stopping for gas and grabbing a tasty snack.

Plus it's a QuikTrip, there isn't really any part of it that isn't awesome."
1,I love this place I have been here 2wice and it puts of the others in the country to shame. I hope that I can volunteer here.
0,"fry's is conveniently located at w germann rd and s alma rd, has a reasonably large selection, and prices are fair.  when grocery shopping, i look for and purchase items based on the best value in terms of product, freshness, selection, and convenience.  i check the weekly sale ads and circle the best buys usually at 3 different food & drug stores.  since these are consumable, recurring items, i will look for opportunities to stock up when great deals come up. the site is clean, well stocked and well organized. common purchases include some baking goods, packed meats, breads, cereals, canned products and eggs. a surprising find...there's a sushi kiosk at the back of the store near the packaged meats section.  so, i buy the freshly made sushi - spicy crab roll, cali roll and tuna roll. it's actually really good.  i usually shop for produce elsewhere, same with laundry products, beauty products and dog food.  those reviews to follow soon.  scored a little lower since parking is usually a near-accident on the weekends, with so many vendors and customers-in-such-a-hurry at that busy shopping center."
0,"I'm not really a fan of Jo-Ann.  They don't really do much to help you find what you need.  There are never any helpful people, nothing is labeled properly, and the fabric counter is always a nightmare.  This one is tolerable because no one is ever here.  The people that they hire at this one are just people who need jobs, not people who love crafts.  You better know what you need and where to find it when you go here because it is easy to get lost and there are no Jo-Ann Sherpas to get you back."
1,"I really like this place and I must say it's the best pizza I have had West of Chicago.  The sauce is on the sweet side, but I like that.  It's kid friendly so it's a great casual place to be with family and friends without a pretentious side to it.

The lines can be a little long at times but I think it's worth the wait."
0,"Terrible experience here. They cut up my foot when trying to remove a callus. Also, they told me they used shellac when it was really gelish. Wish I could recommend, but I wouldn't want anyone else to go through the same experience."
1,"LOVE THIS PLACE!  We eat here every Saturday as long as we are in town.  My husband eats here during the week too!  Weekday lunches are a great deal and quick!  The veggie soup is delicious.  The golden wings - Delicious... chicken satay is good too.  For an entree... we always get Pad Prik King chicken or sometimes shrimp but its always always delicious!  Have been trying to find a thai place with this dish closer to home (east valley) but haven't found one yet!  Service is terrific!  FYI for those of you who just order Pad Thai... it is very sweet here so if you don't like it sweet... order something else.  Other things we've tried that were good... pepper steak - very good - just dont eat a lot of red meat, massamum curry with chicken good... also we order everything medium to thai hot... like very spicy!"
1,"If you are staying in Phoenix for any length of time, this is a must stop for at least a cocktail.  From walking through the kitchen, to being seated promptly in a booth, this is quintessential gastronomic delight.  Durant's is an icon and legend. Period.  Wine list is great, have a well-versed sommelier also.  I never order Filet, but when in Rome..."
1,I really enjoy the food here. Great breakfast fare. Great prices. Great service. The pancakes are really good. I still wonder why people go to Dennys.  This is wayyyyyy better.
1,"Great breakfast, great service. Yummy!"
1,"Neighbors had told me how great this place is and after reading the positive YELP reviews, I decided to have dinner here with my family!

Friendly greeting and service from the moment we walked in the door! Fast service and great food too!

HUGE portions!! I recommend splitting entree's. We ordered 2 entree's between 3 people and had 2 boxes of leftovers we took home! I split the lamb kabobs and the meat was tender and juicy. Hubby had the Gyro's and loved them! (Gyro's were probably enough food for 3 people!!).

Moderate prices. Averaging about $15 bucks a plate, but the dinner plates come with the amazing Basmati rice with white currants, almonds and maybe a touch of cinnamon?

I was told they had the best cannoli's in town.....so I had to save room for one!!...and they were pretty darn good!! 

To sum it up...... FAST~FRIENDLY~FRESH FOOD!!!

Yummy!!"
1,"Stopped in with my two yr old granddaughter today after going to the children's museum, got some raised eyebrows when the cool people  saw the kid but whatever I had to have one of there dirty chai's. Good as usual and the kiddo had a cupcake she thoroughly enjoyed on the drive home."
0,"Returned here after a year's absense. I understand they have had a change in management. some for the better, some for the worse. new general manager and now the service seems much friendlyer and efficient. New chef and now food is slow to arrive and not as good as it used to be. steak was charred, mashed potatos were lukewarm. Took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. hopefully it was just an off night for the kitchen. but the general feel was that they lost the attention to the little details"
0,"False ads, do not stay there. Unless you don't mind a dirty, smelly, overrated hotel. The sheets and towels that were supposed to be white were gray. The place is run down and poorly serviced. The front lobby is clean but once you head up to your room you quickly find out that the place is run down and not being taken care of. I stayed on the fifth floor ""cabana suites"" and as soon as my elevator opened up on the fifth floor, I knew right away I stayed at the wrong place. The ""suites"" were nothing more than a room with a tiny bit of extra elbow space that are on the rooftop area with a pool in the front of the room. The pool was NASTY! (see pictures I uploaded) It was green and looked disgusting and when I arrived to take a look, it had an ""out of order"" sign placed at the entrance. This place was embarrassing! I had told my brothers to book there with me because we thought it was going to be a great hotel based on their website but we were very disappointed again!"
1,"being a rather simpleton, i like my salads with lettuce, tomato, and oil and vinegar...my fish simply baked...my veggies raw....

the ice cream here was very tasty. full of fancy flavors and bits-o-ingredients. but i guess if you want plain ice cream, you go to the supermarket and buy a gallon of store brand. we were cruising the greenbelt at night and saw their sign for ""voted best ice cream"" by the new times, so we decided to hit this place up. it's super cute and modern, but what's so great about this place is the staff. 
our ""server"" was completely into the concept of ""artisan"" ice cream (only in scottsdale can a word like artisan be applied to ice cream...it's not simply ""homemade""). she was super passionate and lively and gregarious, which i really like...because i know she's serving a product she enjoys herself and also wants others to enjoy. 

i had the peach cobbler one and my girl had the basil sorbet. both were very delicious, but at over 6 bucks for 2 small cups, we'll probably have to save our dollars for the supermarket next time. if you have the cash to spare for a snack/dessert, check this place out."
1,"theres a gun check upon entry.

i often forget AZ is quite different than CA....

my first and only experience at cabela's was on black friday. i honestly havent participated in black friday much in past yrs and questioned deals really being deals. but HELLO deals at cabela's.

first of all, they gave away rifles to the first 800 people we were there on black friday. again, im not in cali anymore! this place is an outdoors lover dream. and on top of selection and discounted prices...its almost like an amusement park: 

aquarium room with freshwater fish, back natural history museum-eque taxidermy displays, heads of animals and maps of where they originate from hanging throughout the huge main room, a chocolate shop, and entire cafeteria. 

basically, you can make a day out of cabela's. we were there for 4 hours and i didn't even realize.

but now lets talk about the deals....the deeeeaaallssss.

1,"Great staff without an attitude (which is rare in Scottsdale).  As I was waiting for my party to arrive, I was sitting outside drinking my beer and eating my food.  Without ANY questions and/or hassle, my bill was transferred inside when my party arrived.  Not only that, but our waiter remember exactly what I had and was able to split it without me even asking him to do so.  OK, how great is that?  I am totally sold on the service there an  I will definitely come back.  Very nice unpretentious place."
0,"Meh..not particularly memorable.
I've eaten at this location and the one by ASU, though I like this location better. I would probably only eat here if I was walking by and I was starving. 
The cookies ROCK though, I like that you get one with your sandwich. And they have my favorite flavor of Jones Soda (Sugar-free Black Cherry) which kicked ass. 

Warning: The roast beef sandwich (Overture?) comes with horseradish sauce and it is hot as a mother.  I like the spice but it was almost unbearable. My nose pretty much turned into a snotty waterfall. 

Go to Opa Grill next door instead."
1,"Owned by a serious, James Beard nominee, this is high taste, funky fun for killer Mexican food.  We sat at the bar, and joked with the cool bartenders for a while; all the time trying a myriad of different tacos.  Every single one was great!  This is the real deal, with a creative edge."
1,"More like 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because the overall property was so nice.

Good Food, Good Service, Good View (overlooking the golf course).

I had the Chicken Caprese sandwich which was quite tasty, but the burger my mom has was WAY better.  If you go here.... order a burger.  They are big, juicy and super duper good.  It's also super duper messy.  It's a ""fork and knife"" type of burger. 

Their bloody mary is pretty good... a little too tomato-y.... needed more seasoning.

Mom's John Daly Peach drink was refreshing.  Good for cooling off and relaxing after a round of golf.  :)

Tater Tots were served with our sandwiches and they were good... but nothing all that special.  They were crunchy on the outside and soft and hot on the inside... but for this type of establishment.... I would have expectetd Truffle Tots or something different.

Their relishes that they offered on the side were 'ok'..... I was not impressed.  They tasted like they were from a bottle.... I'm sure they make their own relish... I'm just saying they didn't taste any different than the ones you get at the store."
0,"Wow... After eating sushi from across the nation i have to say Scottsdale's Geisha A Go Go has surprised me for an ultimate low. Andrew, the manager, reassured us that we had something wrong with our taste buds for not tasting how fresh the fish was here. Insulting to assume. Not recommended!!!!"
0,"Great place, well maintained. It's big airport with some long walks."
0,"Finally a place to watch local sports with sound.  I always find it unbelievable that many sports bars here in town look past our local teams and support the foreign hoards from Wisconsin, Minnesota, NY, Illinois etc..  Not at Dukes...local first.

Please return to your frozen tundras and leave us with the Suns, Cardinals, Devils and Coyotes.

The food here is nice bar/pub fare and is always fresh and hot.  Drinks are plentiful and service respectable.  Would like to see a little more variety on the taps but other than that Dukes is a great place to catch a game."
0,"I went to this place after seeing a segment on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (Food Network).  I thought that the fusion of Chinese & Mexican food would be good.  I was a bit disapointed.  The food was okay, but nothing too special.  The establishment itself was clean and the service was quick, so kudos to them for that."
1,"This restaurant is close to my office, so we go for lunch at least once a month.  I love that it's bright, with great modern decor, and the seating is comfortable.  Service is always very good.  The prices and portions are a average for the area.  The cuisine is a twist on Sonoron, but nothing extraordinary."
0,"I was stuck between wanting to give a two star & three star. The concept of this place is a great idea. I have to say that if you happen to go on a day that there's a large party going on, it kinda like you're an unwanted fly on the wall. This play town is located in a large older shopping center that blends in with the other faded store fronts. Inside, the owners seemed to be very nice, although stressed due to hosting a party there. I was very bummed that the jump house was removed. That was 65% of the reason to go. All in all it had it's little themed houses to play in, but the whole place seemed to need a good fresh painting as well as cleaning. $8 admission."
0,"1st off I just want to say that i do actually think the food here is pretty good tasting, regardless of how brown the guac looks.  My problem is the service, everyone who works here is either lazy, dumb or a combo of both.  At Subway they at least pretend to be helpful, here they ask you the same questions over and over (ex. I have been asked what toppings 4 times and I only had 3 things added so really...) and still mess up.  One particular time my friend got a roast beef sandwich and half was roast beef half was pastrami, how is that even possible!?  Either way if they dont shape up they should change their name to Port Hole because its run by a bunch of As*holes."
1,Reviews are dead on good food good service in a little bit of a strange out of the way location.
1,"1st..downtown Mesa needs to get its props. They have some really good places to check out and Mango's is one of them.  Mangos is one of my favorite Mexican food stops. I love their taco salads because their tacos are homemade and soooo delish. 

I also love their 100% fruit juices, so simple and so good. You gotta get there before the lunch crowd if you want some though, they run out super fast. 

Simple, Delish, and fun.  Oh....and here's a lil inside hint, going to the bathroom there is an adventure on its own...."
1,"AY. DIOS. MIO.

The Platano Paleta is a day-maker. There's caramel, creamy, frozen chunks of banana, and aÃ±ejo rum all swirled together on one wooden stick. At least five different people asked me what I was eating and where they could get it as I walked down Mill Avenue, vainly trying not to make eye contact with anyone while eating a popsicle. If you're looking for something new and interesting (and sexy, as popsicles go), eating one of these would be more effective in drowning one's sorrows than a pint of ice cream.

For the more timid, or perhaps just fans of classic flavors, the Fresa con Crema actually smells and tastes of a fresh, organic strawberry upon first bite, until the flavor of rich cream overwhelms the taste buds to create a perfect harmony of awesome and more awesome. Anyone who's partial to artificial strawberry flavor over that of a real strawberry should a) avoid this paleta and b) reprogram your mouth and possibly reevaluate your life. 

Pure fruit lovers, even you cannot escape the appeal of Paletas Betty. The Pura PiÃ±a is almost just a frozen pineapple on a stick, but much more exciting. It's a sweet, delectable confection filled with pineapple pieces and a consistency that's closer to creamy than it is to icy, even though this one's totally vegan. It also contains some sort of hallucinogen that will make you think you're in Jamaica for a short period of time.

Go. Eat. Prosper. You'll probably see me there with a paleta in each hand."
0,"Okay, it's a nice place but I'm not sure I would drive out of my way to go here. I was in town on business staying nearby and thought I'd give them a try. The food was good, but not great. The shredded beef taco was typical and the shredded pork burrito tasted more like beef. The red chili sauce had an okay flavor but the heat level seemed to simply over power everything (and I like hot). The restaurant is very nice inside, very upscale. I guess if you wanted to spend alot for a Mexican dinner in a very nice setting this would be the place. Service was so so, maybe it was because I was a party of one. Whatever the reason, it wasn't a happening thing. Hey, at least the salsa was tasty."
1,"Stayed here with my girlfriend for a Radiohead show and a get away weekend from work.  Got the hotel for the amenities which were great, we played tennis, enjoyed the fantastic people watching at the pool, great cocktails to include the Tequila Sunrise, and some light putt putt outside our cottage.  The room was not ready when we got there so we got a cottage which was supposed to be an upgrade with a semi private patio.  The room was actually very nice and had a great tv which we might have watched for a grand total of 30 minutes in 4 days.  Our room was made up between 4-5 each day that we planned to stay there and then on the day we plan to check out, they came by at 8:30....not sure what the problem was there.  We also had to call about our A/C after we sweated the first night but it was fixed and no problems after that so maybe it was just a glitch which happens.  You are probably wondering what if anything was wrong, the only issue we had was the concierge.....nightmare, no help whatsoever.  Called several times, both girlfriend and I and got the reply on two separate occasions to just check google.  I have stayed at less nice hotels and had much better service with concierge, this hotel should realize what their clients might be interested in and do some research.  

All in all, great trip and a nice and above par stay.  I would certainly stay here again if I can get my girl to go with me!"
1,"3 stars on any given day, my server PAT made this a fun experience and was the extra 2 stars.  Pat is one of the few people in this world who really enjoys being good at what he does.  I asked him, ""how long"" and with much joy he replied, ""I can get your food in 10-15 minutes"".  Sure enough it took 9 minutes.  I value time and in my business my word is everything.  Pat understands this and when I eat here again I will insist on his table.  I recommend you do the same.  ASK FOR PAT!!!

Top notch Pat.  Don't ever change."
1,"I love love love the chicken & hummus appetizer. Its served w/ sauteed spinach and pita. Although its an app, its large enough for a light meal. Most times, I get that w/ the beet salad and split it w/ a friend. Perfect. 

For those of you who avoid beets, I think you'll change your mind w/ this salad. The beets are sweet like candy.  Served w/ feta, mandarin oranges, candied pecans and a very unique pear dressing, you forget you're eating healthy. I've been trying to harvest the pear vinaigrette recipe forever!!! They won't give up the secret sauce! :( 

Enjoy!"
0,"I was very disappointed my last experience at Sauce. I ordered a spinach and apple salad with chicken. I think the apples were from a few days ago wtih no taste and the shredded chicken must have been in the freezer and put on the salad.
The kids however did enjoy their mac and cheese.
The salad was terrible!"
0,"We went here for the fabulous UYE. As the restaurant is often empty, Julia though it would be good to give them some business...but in the end it was our group that ended up being given the business. The words highway robbery come to mind, but I guess we weren't really on the highway. The prices listed on the menu really didn't seem that out of line, a bit on the pricey side but nothing alarming. Our waitress slyly sold us a kazillion dollars worth of appetizers that were not on the menu. We got 4 plates which consisted of 4 individual sauces with some stuff in them...one had shrimp, one had chicken, one had pork, and one had chihuahua. Oh wait, I think that was the cheese on top. Anyway, the plate with 4 tablespoons of sauce was not worth the $25...oh wait, we got 4 of them. The waitress also managed to slip two orders of guacamole in on us for $11 a piece. As far as the entrees are concerned, the portions were small and the food was kind of meh. The mole was way too sweet for my taste. The biggest bummer of all was NO BOOZE! The $120 worth of appetizers would have gone over much better if they were washed down with some frosty margaritas. A couple of pitchers and they could have slipped us some $100 flan.

Regardless of the price and the mediocre food, it was well worth going for the amazing company of the awesome Phoenix Yelpers. I don't think I would go back for the food though."
0,"Had great expectations after highly recommended by others. The breakfast was good, nothing extraordinary though. The service was a disappointment, server was very forgetful and put off by some simple requests. It doesn't look like they need my business though, considering the line to get in. I probably wont be back."
0,"When you walk into Sky Harbor, you are bombarded with declarations that it's the country's ""friendliest airport"". Huh. What does this mean? User-friendly? Friendly in a ""you'll always feel at home here"" way? Didn't really know, but it seems extremely important to their PR group, since when you sign on for the wi-fi, you can't change pages until you rate how friendly the airport is from a drop down menu. 

It might be doing a disservice by proclaiming it as the superlative of congeniality. Expectations run high -- at least by me. I found the free wi-fi extremely friendly. Yeah!! Star for that. I found the den-like check in area (at least in Terminal 3), not so friendly as it left me feeling a little depressed. The TSA officer who confiscated my 4 oz (apparenly it's 3.4 oz in PHX) Neutrogena sun screen not so friendly...but not malicious, and I guess I wouldnt be so friendly if I were charged with monitoring tenths of ounces hour after hour. The spoke-security system I found to be not so friendly to both users and retail. I never like seeing a plethora of places to purchase items BEFORE security, leaving you with only a few outlets for you to browse in your little concourse. I hate wondering, what do gates 1-14 get to purchase? Is my concourse more vacant than the others? Just put security before ALL the retail and let us wander a bit. 

Overall, not a bad airport. at all. the friendliest? i don't know, but the free wi-fi certainly made me leave with a smile on my face!"
1,"Just off University, but manages to feel like a little hide-away, and pulls off an enticing mellow atmosphere, suitable for intimate conversation.

Fish Tacos and a Margarita again please! How many times before I can force myself to experiment?"
1,"Okay I have found my new favorite ""home office!""  I don't have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.

Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.

The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.

A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich."
0,"Okay now this is a large chain and on average it's okay to good!  and I have been to this place many, many times, but I have to say the last time I went there for the happy hour hot wings (they were dry, over cooked) then I had ordered a steak and seafood combo (Cajun) something but after my second brew I thought it was me, so I had the wife and my son taste it man was it salty!!!!  It tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in the food, but my waitress assured me that could not have happened ""because all there sauces come in bags and are pre-made"" (Gross, that did it for me) I  was outta there with the quickness..."
0,Not a bad place.  Pizza was good but stay away from the wraps as the flatbread wasn't meant for that.
1,"Food is great.  Really good deal, lots of tasty food for a great price.  My favorite combo is the Pulled Pork sandwich with side of Mac & Cheese & Coleslaw & Kool Aid.  Founded by former NFL & ASU Football player they know how to barbecue I truly recommend everyone trying it out.  The atmosphere is not that inviting yet the food is worth staying and will get you to come back I can guarantee,"
1,"I didn't stay here, but patronized their restaurant. The servers were very polite and accommodating. They frequently refilled our drinks and aimed to serve by making sure the fireplaces were working. It's a nice place to hang at if you have a reason to be here."
1,"Say hello to the Ghost Lounge, folks. This is a brand new bar located right next to Seamus, within the San Carlos through an agreement with the hotel's ownership. 

For years, I've thought the Hotel San Carlos was an under-appreciated (through its own fault) downtown venue. With the Ghost, the owner has finally executed a plan to revive its rightful place on the downtown Phoenix scene. This is apparent from the first step inside the lobby, which appears as it did in 1928 when the hotel first opened. If celebrities in the 1930s had to spend the night in Phoenix, back then a small, un-airconditioned cowboy town with around 50,000, they would have stayed here. (Or else the near-by Westward Ho). You get a taste of those times with the massive photographic blow-ups the Ghost has put up on its walls of various scenes from early 20th century downtown Phoenix. So large that you can zero in on individual pedestrians on the streets, and marvel at their bowties, cowboy hats, handkerchiefs and facial expressions. Back then, the San Carlos was probably one of the only places in town that was ""air-cooled."" (That may have meant it had swamp coolers. I haven't googled the history of air conditioning technology for this review.)

I'd describe the bar's style as grandiose, and classic old school Phoenix with an obligatory hint of Chicago (obligatory given the decades-old economic relationship betweeen the two cities that endures to this day). It has been beautifully done. I will be back often."
0,"The doctors are great, especially Dr Mouaikel but the set up to communicate is not patient oriented at all .  When the office is closed for lunch 12-2PM you cannot even leave a message .  You need to call back again and listen to the lenghtly preamble about directions , office hours, emergency numbers etc.  You still have to press the correct number and leave a phone number for a return call.  The return call is late that day or even the next day.
The recording suggests yiu use the website yet you have to be signed up for the website and I cannot find out on the website how you get signed up.  
I would rather go to the DMV rather than have to call the AIA office for other than an appointment.."
0,"Hmmm ... where to start.  Food was good, flavorful, no complaints; although for the price I did not think the portions were that great - but everything was tasty and everyone enjoyed their meals.

It's a big open place, with concrete floors and picnic table type environment.  Patio with misters and big open doors to the outside.  A good atmosphere for BBQ.  Someone mentioned the parking being marginal (very true - same as when this was a bar in it's prior life).  I think my biggest downside is how much I had to serve myself - go to the counter to order, pay, get to table, get drinks, get place settings (plastic utensils), for a beer have to go to the separate bar area, order, pay, return for more, etc. (can't order beer where you order food).

While I enjoyed the food, not sure how often I'll be back - would not want to be there when it was crowded and have to wait in lines repeatedly."
1,"I've visited the Crudo in Old Town and was really excited when the new one opened in Arcadia.  Visited with the bestie a nice quiet weeknight to enjoy some girl time.  You can get a 3 course meal for $35 and pick from salads, meats or what I would call side dishes.  It's a bit pricey for what you get portion-wise, unless you decide to order 3 meats..but who does that?  The wine is very reasonably priced.  The food is amazing!  Everything is cooked and seasoned perfectly, and presented to be delicious.  The decor is very simple, feels like you are in a big open warehouse.  It'd be a great place to have a group dinner for 6-10 as they have these rooms that are a bit more secluded they could put you in.  The service was a bit too good, to the point where we almost felt like she was rushing us even though there was nobody else in the restaurant.  

I'd visit again, but this is definitely a place to take another food loving girl friend- the boyfriend would be hungry and feel ripped off, it's just not his style..."
1,"It's the place to be. 

I went before heading over to Symphony Hall and seeing Ballet AZ perform Giselle. Having heard great reviews about the place, it's food and the vibe... I had to try it.

Restored into a restaurant and bar from an old department store, Hanny's has the feel straight of of New York City. The lighting is dim enough to give that sexy, intimate feelings and with long, pew style seating with individual tables, the vibe is very posh.

My roommate and I ordered the bruscetta plate and the margarita pizza. Very good choice! The bruscetta plate was on the saltier side, so be wary of that but it was delish. The pizza was much bigger than we expected. For $10 you really do get a good deal. 

We each orded drinks. A orded the peach martini and a glass of giseling. Wasn't a HUGE fan of the martini and I thought it tasted like cough syrup but it was also my very first martini so I am not holding Hannys against anything. My roommate on the other hand said it was the best Manhattan he'd ever had, which I believe.

Hannys has a modern feel with a touch of Mad Men and I simply cannot wait to go back."
1,"I went to Khai Hoan yesterday and ordered the rare beef pho.  Now, this is the first time I have had pho before and I would say it is much like a glorified bowl of Ramen Noodles.  That said, it was good.  To me, not great, just good.  We got the combination appetizer plate.  The spring roll was amazing.  The crab was great.  I didn't like the ""egg roll"" as much as I thought I would, but it was definitely fresh.  I had fresh coconut juice to drink and it was delightful.  I would go back again for sure, but I would be ordering something other than the pho."
1,"This is quite possibly the best hamburger on the planet.  I live for In-N-Out Burger when I head West and I was impressed by the friendliness of the staff and speed with which my order was processed during a busy Thursday evening.

I'd give this location 5 stars (and if I were rating the burger and service alone, it's no contest), but I was disappointed by the fries.  They didn't taste as fresh as usual.  That said, they weren't stale or frozen, so they beat every other fast food chain.

I'd certainly go back since my Double Double without, with pickles, sliced chilis, and extra spread was AMAZING.

Be aware: they do not accept American Express, but Visa and Mastercard are just fine."
1,"As a frequent antiques consumer, I can honestly say that Lizabel's Treasures is my favorite antique store in Phoenix. I've been a customer for several years, and Lizabel's is my first (and often only) stop.

Why Lizabel's is such a treasure is because of these things: price, desirable antiques, and great customer service. John and Bette know what people want, and they go to great lengths to get the antiques that people want and to make their customers happy. I'm a believer.

They consistently have one-of-a-kind quality furniture and pieces that you would not normally find elsewhere in town. Pieces are priced very agreeably, so you can afford to stock up or furnish a whole room without busting the bank.

John and Bette have created the kind of family business that is to be admired. They have a legion of supportive customers, and I'm one of them. I can always find them to be helpful and interested in getting me what I want, even if I don't always know what I want.

Lisabel's Treasures is the place to build a relationship with, because as one's life's needs changes, so does the need for different pieces and furniture. I can always count on finding something I really love at their store, and you will, too."
0,"3.5 stars. 

We decided to check this place out after all the waves. The space and decor is nice and cute, and girly! We arrived at 10:30 for a Sunday brunch, and there were plentiful of empty seats for us to choose. Nice patio, too!

I had the French Toast with fresh strawberries and chicken apple sausage (however, the menu says with raspberry, I didn't really care for either one, meh~) The toasts were thick and soft, but weren't that outstanding. I really liked the chicken apple sausages on the other hand, they were tasty and not the typical greasy kind. Friend had the Spinach and Tomato Omelette with feta cheese. I didn't take a bite, but she really enjoyed it. It came with a side of potatoes and fresh fruits.  

Our waitress was nice, but the service was slow... Overall we had a nice little trip. It's definitely a good spot for a girls' day out!"
0,"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago. The owner was snoring when I walked in, so that was odd and kind of a turn off. Their regular manicures are cheap- $10, but the experience overall was so-so. It got busier as my manicure was going on, so it got a little better. Parking is pretty bad..they have approx. 3 spaces. Manicure was fine..have a range of OPI but all their polishes were jumbled together which I hate. Overall, for a few dollars more there are better places, even down the street."
1,"What a joy to discover Thai Lahna with my friend Keith Galbut who has been going here for over 10 years. I can see why. Family owned and operated - and everyone is very friendly and helpful. Of course all that matters is the food, right - and it's marvelous. We tried several dishes and all were well spiced and wonderful. Highly recommended."
0,"Sam's Club is having a ground beef recall. Call the store for details.  I am just all about the FYI today! ;-)

They said they sent paper and electronic mailers - but I did not get one. I just got lucky and happen to be returning the brown ground meat that I just bought.

I am rarely able to find fresh ground meat or chicken here, but their roasts have always been fresh and very reasonable. I can get double the size here for the price I would pay (for a smaller one) at Fry's. 

And, if it is not quality meat, just return it for a 200% refund = one of the only reasons that I will try to get meat here. Although, for the hassle, it is really not worth it. 

Also, if for any reason you don't like the club itself, they will refund your membership. Look it up; it's on their website.


They are trying - but be wary of the ground meat and chicken there. It is often not very fresh. But.... I can sometime find fresh ORGANIC produce here - nothing much really - last time it was spinach. It was really cheap however, and getting organics at wholesale prices is rare."
0,"This place is a must go if you are some beer starved party animal ASU student but as an adult who is one step beyond the let's get blottoed for the sake of getting drunk this place isn't really worth visiting.  The beers really aren't that good compared to Four Peaks/Papago/Sun Up/San Tan, or any of the other brew pubs around.  Really wasn't that impressed with the food either.  The only reason I gave it an extra star than one because the service was good, of course there were only one other group in the place at the time."
1,"Are you one who likes the smell of a brand new car? How about the smell, or in this case, lack of smell, of a brand new gym? Now, for a limited time, a completely unsullied 24 Hour Fitness, at the MetroCenter, of all places.

At its current new state (it's been open for a week), this 24 Hour is in much better condition than the one on Camelback. No surprise there - everything inside here is brand spanking new.

The details:

* In contrast to other 24 Hours in the Valley, this one actually will remain open 24/7 (versus closing at night on the weekends). The guy at the front desk said this is due to how this location is zoned vs the other ones.

* The cardio area is equipped with 11 flatscreen TVs hanging from the ceiling, with one even tuned into soccer-centric GolTV (which means one less tuned to all those talking heads on brainless cable news stations - bonus). 

* The adjoining weight area is larger than the Camelback location and currently has all its dumbbells in place on the correct shelves, and all its weight machines are working. No new types of machines, though (this is a 24 Hour Fitness after all) but still all the standards, plus four flat benches and four incline benches.   

* Full basketball court (which could also be split into two half-sized courts). Camelback lacks this.

* Large stretch/ab area which also includes some contraption straight out of Tron/Blade Runner. I stood there and looked at all the diagrams, acknowledged that it must be useful, and walked away.

* Standard group X classroom, childcare

* A spotless pool area. If you've been to many 24 Hour Fitness, you'll know that this is a hugely appreciated factor. I anticipate it's not going to remain spotless for long, but doing laps in a crystal clear pool was awesome. No dankness here (yet). 

* Spotless lockerroom with wood-paneled lockers and branded Dial Ultimate Clean hair & body wash. I'm assuming the women's lockerroom has their own corporate soap sponsor (I find all this a little odd, but go figure).  But beyond soap, there's some contraption called SuitMate which is like a salad spinner for your swim trunks. Just throw your trunks inside it, press down, and in 30 seconds your trunks are water-free. How awesome is that?

* Is going here after work safe for your car, you ask? Well, when I left the gym two hours later at around 9:45 pm, my car was still there in the parking lot, untouched. Seems like the MetroCenter is full of surprises.

* All in all, a great gym that I'm sure will be a welcome addition to the area. However, it still rates 4 stars since:

A) Although all the equipment is brand new and the latest edition of everything, there is fitness equipment at other gym chains that this one is lacking. 

B) I'm anticipating what the gym will be like in 6 months. If it manages to stay as clean as it is now by that time, maybe a 5th star will be in order."
0,"If there was a way I could give this restaurant NO stars, I might have.  The chips and salsa are the ONLY thing that requires a star here.

The service was less than average, the food was hotter than the surface of the sun, and the drinks were teeny tiny (and didn't much taste like alcohol).  My husband ordered a green chile dish and it came smothered in red sauce, when he asked the waiter if it looked green or red, the server said, ""nope that's what green looks like"".  WOW!

Sorry but I don't think I will be returning."
1,"While I don't like to hype places up (because really, how GOOD can any one place be) ...How good can one burger joint be over another, or how good can pizza be over another pizza place (when weighing the ones that are all generally Good in the Public Opinion).  Now the word around town is that The Grind is Sofa_King Great.  I will say about The Grind that when you're up for a Burger, this place hits the spot.  I've been here once before August 2010 (don't remember what burger I had but recall it was good) and the other night I had the Peppercorn Burger and it was as good as it gets.  I was starving and really hadn't eaten all day and that helped add to how much this hit the spot, but make no mistake, it was really good and I do enjoy this place for the atmosphere, service, and quality of food.  My friends wife got one of those healthy wraps and she liked it a lot.  The sweet potato fries (we ordered the half sweet potato and half regular fries) and they were good.

As for some other areas to review: The atmosphere is nice.  It's casual and not too dark and not too light inside.  (That's how I like it).  There's multiple flat panel TV's above the bar, so plenty of games on at any given time (That's also how I like it).  The service is fine (although based on some other reviews people have been so so satisfied about the service.  That's often going to be the case with most casual establishments - so sometimes it's good, and sometimes not to our satisfaction).  Such is Life!  Anyway, back on track here, the Wait staff and Bar staff have been worth the 20% tip both times.  No complaints by me about this place, however I do see some 2 and 3 star ratings on here.  

Where I will dock 1 star and sort of agree with Kristi D.  She mentioned the large photo of Sheriff Joe Arpaio on the wall (while I sense that Kristi doesn't care for Sheriff Joe, I'm neutral about him), but I agree about all the oversized photos of notable names in town who have dined in The Grind.  I'd much rather see real artwork or real photographs on the wall - and not photos of Sheriff Joe, Mark Grace (for those who don't know, he's a former baseball player), and the Mayor of Paradise Valley, all holding their burgers.  Who the hell cares about any of them and their burgers.  I think I'd be more ok with having these photos above me, but they are HUGE enlargements and a bit overkill.  And they are for sale and the proceeds go to some cause.  Look, I'm all for causes and shit, but I wouldn't spend my money on a 36 inch enlargement of these local ""notables"" holding a burger.  The whole concept is pretty stupid.  But hey, I'm generally uptight and been doing photography 20+ years and probly am just hating on the fact that my photos are hanging on the wall.
 
Side Note:  For those who might have previously had ""Liked"" The Grind on Facebook but no longer have their page as a Like, it's because they apparently had their group page hacked, so they had to start over.  I found this out when I Liked it the other day noticed there were only about 165 Like's, and certainly I knew this place was way more popular than that.  When I commented that, they commented back about it being hacked and starting the page over.

1,"Very good food served quickly.  Add a little hot sauce and some soy sauce, mix it together.  Eat.

Price is low and quality is high.  You really can't ask more than that."
0,"My husband and I went there for our first time today. What a mistake. First of all, the ladies bathroom had no soap or paper towels to wash/dry your hands. My husband had the steak sandwich and I had the chicken ranch. There was so little meat on the sandwiches that we were perplexed when we were finished.  The inside trash was overflowing. I have been sick to my stomach the last hour....never again."
0,"Priceline had this resort as 4 star but it looks and  feels like 3.
The employees are nice, though. WiFi 13$/24hrs.
Grounds are nice."
1,Outside atmosphere was really nice. This was my first time there and I enjoyed it. Our food was great. I had a salad and my friend had the filet which looked excellent. It was more pricey than I expected though.
1,"These guys have the tacos and nachos thing figured out. Great decor and hot, hot waitresses. 

We had lunch and it was pretty quiet. Good service. I'm sure things get crazy at night, though!"
1,"Very friendly, warm atmosphere.  We went for breakfast after hiking Camelback.  We figured we'd earned some fried chicken after making it to the top in 85 degree weather.  The food was really good.  Everything looked great! We got one of the breakfast specials - biscuits with gravy, 2 eggs and potatoes and I got 2 pieces of chicken with one waffle.  For once we didn't need any take home containers!  We ate every single bite which is very unusual for us.  I have to go back to get some more chicken and waffles but need to be sure I try the mac and cheese which I saw so many people enjoying and I need to try an order of their grits."
1,Best happy hour in north Scottsdale! Get there early to beat the crowd. Amazing cuisine and atmosphere.
0,Very average. Food was overdone and waitress stopped chomping her gum only long enough to take our order.
1,"Don't let the name deceive you. Beaver Choice is an EXCELLENT dining experience. 

My girlfriend and I decided on a whim to give it a shot (after making the obligatory puns and double entendre's on the name). After staring at the menu for two minutes, trying desperately to decipher what we were to have, we gave up and asked the guy behind the counter's advice. His name was Chris and he was extremely helpful. He sold us with free samples, rather than descriptions of the plate. 

I ordered the gravlax; my girlfriend ordered the laxpudding. We entrusted the quality of our meal to the word of Chris and the small sample we tasted, because, in my mind, the ingredients had no business being together in one dish. Both dishes were based on lox, aka smoked salmon. 

We were both pleasantly surprised at the dish that greeted each of us a few minutes later. The food was EXCELLENT! And while not the cheapest dinner in the world, you get an enormous bang for your buck. Your plate is literally stacked with food. Kudos if you finish it all. 

Bottomline: Beaver Choice has a weird-ass name, but it serves some of the best food in Tempe. We will be back for sure, and I encourage each of you to give it a shot. I guarantee you won't come away disappointed!"
1,"Cute, small little place that I never noticed until a friend and I went one night for dinner. It's in a strip mall which doesn't really scream elegant, gourmet or even 'good' but this place reminded me of a place one would find in LA or NYC. As I mentioned, it's small. The restaurant is connected to a wine store that serves food as well. Kind of like Sportsman's. 

The menu changes a lot. It's a good deal to go for the four or seven course meal. Go hungry and take someone you'll enjoy spending 3+ hours with at the dinner table. 

What stands out in my mind is the dessert - which I'm not big on desserts - but it was a buttermilk pound cake with honey and light whipped cream and nectarines. Heavenly!"
1,"Service is good... The newer waitors tend to forget you're there. Food is delicious, never gotten food poisoning... Cheesecake is magnificent... The best kind is the Godiva, expensive bit worth it!"
1,"I visited this place in January while I was in Phoenix and I miss the food! My vegan friend suggested this place to me and my other friend (we were skeptical that vegan food could taste good)...she proved us wrong!

The food here was delicious, I'd eat here regularly if I lived in Phoenix! When we arrived, we were worried about the hours since we got there pretty close to closing time, but they were cool! We shared the samosas and buffalo wings for appetizers. I ordered the Thai Peanut bowl with mock chicken and noodles for my entree. I felt like everything was flavored well and while I enjoy meat normally, this opened my mind to trying other vegetarian places in the future. I liked the ambiance here, great place to grab a bite with friends and chill. It was the perfect place to stop by after a busy weekend! I'll be back next time I'm in the area."
1,"Quick, friendly, awesome."
1,"Vintage sodas sold by bottle, all of your grandmother's favorite childhood candy, an abundance of gag gifts and novelty items... you just can't dislike this place. Each time I'm in, I spend a good hour just perusing the countless Fred & Friends products and debating whether or not I should buy the stick-on-mustaches or 10 of the Chinese finger traps. 

But, let's be honest here. I mostly go for the photo booth. By far the best photo booth in town... good quality pictures (not cheap like the ones inside the mall) and they have little masks, glasses, and mustaches-on-a-stick you can use in case you're tired of flashing the peace sign or making that horrendous duck face.

Soda. Candy. Toys. Photo booth. Don't kid yourself. You're never too old for that ish."
0,"I didn't have a fully immersed Portland's experience, so perhaps I am selling them a bit short, but as far as my experience went, it was A-OK.

We stopped in because of its proximity to the light rail and our need for alcoholic refreshment.  We had a couple beers (small selection - but we found something we really liked) and a glass of wine (reasonably priced, tasty) The service was fine, the prices fine.  Everything was fine.

And that's just it.  Does 'Fine' merit a 'Yay! I'm a fan', four star review.  No it does not.  Maybe the food is out of this world.  Maybe at night this place lights up and sparkles in a way that the daytime cannot convey.  Its on the light rail, so I may give it another attempt, but on first glance, Portland's is just A-OK."
1,"I haven't been here in a while.  I like how they have remodeled this Fry's, even though it is not even 5 years old, they revamped it a little.  Today they had awesome deals for certain participating items.  I am glad I read the flyer I got in the mail.  I am glad I have their VIP card, I got a lot of stuff for only $45."
0,"The caramel ones were heaven on earth, but I agree with the other Yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry side.

I still have quite a few flavors to sample, but from what I have seen so far, they are not worth the price point."
1,"Best burger I've ever had, and a great view from the patio.  Enjoyed a wonderful date with my husband there."
0,"Good food when it's slow. Not so good when super busy. This is usually a great place to stop after watcning a show at the Harkins theater nearby. If the lot is full on a Friday or Sat night I would pass and go somewhere a little less overwhelmed. Although the service there has always been pretty good for us, the food is hit and miss."
1,Came here with a large group a while back.  We were there to eat and have a beer before a concert there. It was a weekday so we made it to happy hour. Happy Hour pricing was fair. The food was pretty good. The very best thing there is the beer!  They had like everything on tap! MMMM!
1,"I loved this place.  It was a little pricey but all the stuff in it had some kind of paperwork.  The paperwork explained about the materials used. I thought the lady who worked there was nice.  Don't skip go in---even if you don't buy you can soak up a little astmosphere,"
1,Love the wings!
1,"Citizen Public House is a great addition to the Old Town dining scene. I love seeing restaurants crop up in that part of town that aren't just catering to the bar scene and making the food an afterthought. My girlfriend and I made reservations for Friday night expecting Bernie Kantak's new restaurant to be packed. Much to our surprise when we arrived, the place was pretty dead with tons of open tables. We purposely arrived early to enjoy a cocktail at the bar and even though we could have been seated right away, we pressed forward with our original plan.

At the bar, I ordered my usual cocktail while the GF ordered a sangria off their cocktail menu. We also ordered an order of the bacon fat heirloom popcorn from the bar snacks menu. My cocktail was perfectly made and my GF loved the sangria. The popcorn took forever to come out, but when it was delivered they also brought out an order of the calamari compliments of the chef. The popcorn was a little bit burned and we both thought it could have used some salt, which was surprising since we thought the bacon fat would have provided that flavor. The calamari was perfectly cooked and not greasy in the least. I enjoyed the pickled fennel on the side, but my GF isn't a fan of fennel, so she didn't try it.

After we finished our cocktails at the bar, we moved to a table for the main event. In an unusual move for us, we skipped wine and stuck with beer and cocktails, but I did eye some good finds on the concise wine list. For our appetizer, we ordered the sausage of the day, which was a beef based sausage with a cabbage casing. It was very unique and we both really enjoyed it. For our main courses, the GF ordered the AZ B.L.T. and ordered the Pork Tender Loin. The B.L.T. had tons of perfectly crispy bacon on it, but we both agreed that it was really good , but not great overall. The Pork Tender Loin, on the other hand, was excellent in my opinion. I loved the figs and the sweet potato-chevre strudel. Of course, you could put chevre on anything and I would like it.

When it was time for dessert, we knew that we had to try some of Tracy Dempsey's latest creations. We normally split dessert, but decided to each get our own. The GF got the cookies and milk and I had the chocolate toffee bread pudding. The cookies are delivered in a bag that you can take home, which is great because you probably won't down the generous serving of cookies in one setting  unless you're sharing. My GF was quite happy to take home a little bag of cookies to enjoy later. My bread pudding was awesome and I wish I could have purchased a gallon of the Maker's Mark ice cream to take home with me. I'll definitely be craving this dessert in the future.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is a little austere, even for my taste. It just seems like they could a little bit to make it a little bit more warm and inviting. Service, while extremely friendly, was a little bit uneven throughout the night starting with the snacks at the bar taking a long time and continuing with confusion over what tables plates should be delivered to. Keep in mind the restaurant has been open for only a week, so these are things that can be worked out.

We were really surprised to see the restaurant so empty on a Friday night, so I hope more people give it a try. Citizen is a really good neighborhood restaurant that has the potential to be great. We look forward to trying it again to see how it improves and evolves. I'm really hoping it's a successful staple in Old Town for years to come."
1,"Hey hotel room snobs, I am totally with you that swank hotel rooms are the best. But when that's not in your budget & you just need a decent place to crash in Old Town, this is your place. I think my room was like $48 a night. That's cheaper than a cab ride home for some people.

Plus they have free, albeit somewhat dodgy breakfast in the morning. I stayed for a few days, did some shopping & drinking. I could walk to Fashion Square, & cabs were cheap to anywhere in Old Town. Sure these places haven't been remodeled since the eighties, but who cares when there's free wifi!"
1,"This place is always one of the first places my husband and I go to, once we are in a city that has one. Having lived in Phoenix for around 10 years, this has always been one of my favorites. Recently they have added new rolls and sushi to their menu, and I must say, Great job!"
0,"NOOOO!!! 
Don't think about it!!!!

Had my windshield replaced by these schmucks. The morons tore up the interior of my car, and damaged a speaker cover. 

I had to call them about replacing the cover thrice, they finally did, and then I found out that there was a HUGE air leak in the corner. They never fixed the interior trim.

They sent out the same first idiots to plug the leak, and they ended up breaking a ton of clips for a covering on my car, ruining the windshield wiper covers, and DOUSING my tweeter in water. I called immediately after they left and got harassed by a ""manager"" because he just had hip surgery (why is this my fault?!) and couldnt come until a week out!

Whatever incentives they offer are not worth the TERRIBLE craftsmanship and poor service. 
I am exploring my options with a lawyer, and have reported them to BBB."
1,"I haven't written a review in ages, but this place is SO GOOD that I'd be ashamed of myself if I didn't review it.

I am the most hyberbolic person in the whole world in the history of time, but this time, when I say that it was the best pancakes I've ever had, I'm not kidding.  Just insanely delicious.  Scrambled eggs were also some of the best I've had (and come on, they're scrambled eggs, so you don't expect that much variety), and the breakfast potatoes were very good.  I couldn't pinpoint the seasoning, but it's different than you usually get.

Coffee:  Yum.  I don't think I'd even heard of Arbuckle's, but apparently it's got a great reputation, and deservedly so.

The owner Joe stopped by our table, and was super nice and genuine.  Service was just fine too.

I'm sure Joe's will get a reputation and huge following soon, so believe the hype and check it out."
0,"Bad customer service!  

No one at the front desk for thirty minutes.  Plus they left the phone on the counter so when I tried to call their number, phone just kept ringing and ringing.  :("
1,Fresh bread....awesome beans!!! Raspado...tostitos!!!!
1,"Went there for the first time today.  Excellent burger, and all the extra's on the burger are free which is pretty nice.  It was just over 10 bucks for a cheeseburger, regular fries, and large drink. The food was excellent.  I ding it down to 4 stars though, just because anything this good has to be unhealthy, and its definitely greasy.   The grease from the fries saturday my brown paper take-out bag.  They also squished the top of my bun pretty bad when wrapping it up in tin foil.  I'm guessing if you eat there, you don't have this problem as much.  Still, 4 stars for an excellent burger and fries place.  Definitely a step up over In-N-Out."
1,"I have been to this Mojo fro yo location several times now and really enjoy their yogurts! The yogurt tastes great, is light and refreshing and somewhat healthy if you avoid all of the chocolately/candy toppings yet they offer tons of fruit options. Priced by weight, a great stop after retail therapy at Saks or dessert after Stingray Sushi or True Food at the Biltmore. A must try, plus they have punch cards for free fro yo after a couple of visits! :)"
1,"A great little spot to find! Fresh, Fresh, Fresh Sushi and great eats! Be sure to try the green bean appetizer!"
1,"Today our travels took us to the Chandler Mall on 10/31/2012. Therefore we were near to Abuelo's for lunch. Nothing like returning to a Restaurant that you found to be very good! We arrived after 1PM, so we were seated ASAP.

We ordered drinks first along with a serving of Guacamole. Nice way to start off lunch! My wife ordered the Dilla Lunch while I ordered the Grande Burrito Lunch special. Both item arrived on a very hot plate-wonderful! Whenever we are dining at another Restaurant, a hot plate is always expected but all too often the hot plate fails to appear.

Our lunch stay hot until the last bite due to the hot plate service. Everything was great with the meal and no requested drink refills-always a sign of great service!

Both restrooms were very clean and serviced many times during the day. We highly recommend Abuelo's for a great lunch or dinner!"
0,Another place that's walking distance. Subway is one of those places where you can't go wrong....you got 5-dollar value meals or foot longs. The guys are really friendly and aren't stingy with the toppings. I'm not a big fan of the smell subway's have though. Eh anyways its just one of those places where im lazy and don't want to make a sandwich...plus it helps me keep my girlish figure like jared :)
0,"I had high hopes for the Habit since I live only a couple miles away, but it was mostly disappointing for me.  I'm vegetarian, so I have no idea how their meat burgers taste, and they may be the best in the world for all I know, but the veggie burger was a tasteless lump for the most part.  I do give them kudos for having a veggie burger, but either put more effort into it, or take it off the menu and go full-on meat!

The service was nice, and I like the design of the place, but there are too many good veggie burgers to be had in the Valley to waste my time eating this one.  Parking lot is super-cramped, so if you need your meatburger fix, then don't come right at 12 or 6, unless you want to park in someone's yard."
0,"This place is a bit scary.  (And since it is a Chinese restaurant, that means a little more than scary).  It's dark, (even though its been remodeled at least once since it has changed owners a few times).  It serves mostly Cantonese based cuisine although most of the waitstaff tend to speak Mandarin.  I'm actually Chinese and notice these things.  There is some live seafood.  I usually go here for lunch when we have a crowd.  It is inexpesive and fairly quick to get in and out.  A bit heavier on the salt and sauces than I would like though.  I tend to go to my old standbys Great Wall or my newer loves Nee House or South China knowadays."
1,"LOVE it here. I stay at hotels about 80 nights a year for work, and often go to Phoenix. Gotta say, if it weren't for the ""hood"" neighborhood, I would've given it 5 stars. The restaurant next door, Bobby Q, has rave reviews, so it seems like a convenient place to eat, but that seems to be the only dinner place around. Good thing it's the Residence Inn, with a small kitchenette.

This is probably the cleanest hotel I've stayed in all year. The dishes and silver wear are very clean and housekeeping keeps it that way daily. I've stayed at places twice the amount of this Residence Inn in Scottsdale and dishes in the kitchenette were filthy. 

Small workout room but you can go to the LA Fitness down the street for free.  Oh, they don't skimp on breakfast-waffles, eggs, sausage, yogurt, fresh fruit and hot and cold cereal. 

Beds don't look comfy but they are Devine.  I had some of my best nights sleep here. It's nice to stay at a place that is more like a home than a hotel."
1,"Walking in was like seeing a rainbow for the first time. UH-mazing! Every type of candy ever created and more candies that you've never even heard of. Best part about it was that it was super affordable. It was like a mini-costco of just candy. 

I ended up going twice on Saturday. Love it!"
0,"Firesky Resort is a marvelous place to unwind and enjoy the warm dry evening air and fire-lit torches.  Whenever I have the opportunity to stay in the Kimpton Hotel Group's locations, I always know I've made the right choice.  The hotel was beautiful, hip and inviting.  

I gave them three stars because the rooms were a nice, but not fabulous, the amenities of L'occitane products definitely helped.  The restaurant Taggio was fine, wasn't spectacular and definitely was the part of the hotel which was least memorable.  

The staff was friendly and helpful.  I'd stay here again, but with the expectation of enjoying the wonderful pool/cabana area and leaving the resort for dinner.  Scottsdale has so much to offer, what was I thinking...."
1,"I havne't been into Radio Milano quite as many times as I have been into Postino, but I have to say of those times I have, I was impressed. They have complimentary valet parking which in this neighborhood is a huge plus!

Their menu has many different dishes to choose from along with the daily special that always sounds great. The other night when some friends and I stopped in the special was short rib ravioli, yum right? Well, I wasn't able to fiund out, as they were sold out for the evening. I instead got the linguini with clams, and I am glad I did. One of the tastiest things I have eaten in awhile. It was with a light cream/butter sauce with garlice and leeks and clams. If you like clams I would deffinatly recomend this dish, it's perfect!

They also have some interesting things on the menu you I am excited to try next time I stop in; deviled eggs, olive oil cake, and their mac 'n cheese.

Their wine list was nice, decently priced as well. Radio Milano has a warm cozy inviting feel, anyone can have a good time. Just be mindfull that it is an open room, and talking to your neighbor as if you were at a football game is not the most polite thing to do. I wish the ladies that were out for a batchlorette party that night could have gotten the memo, ""they were loud"" is an understatment. None the less, we had a great dinner."
1,"Since this is a Kimpton Hotel my standards are fairly high. 

The reception area and pool are very well done, in typical Kimpton fashion. The rooms are nice, however could use more work. The bathrooms are completely remodeled, but the little amenities that I'm use to like the Ipod docking station, flat screen tv, cordless phone, room service past 11pm and multiple outlets (i'm an electronics junkie) just aren't there. The room really feels like any other average hotel. 

The spa was lovely, but it is not a full spa. I was hoping to sit in the steam room before my 90min massage, but unfortunately there wasn't one to sit in. The massage room was nice and the largest I had ever been in. It had it's own private bath/changing room and a large copper tub close to the actual massage table. I was pretty bummed I didn't add a bath to my massage. 

All in all I would stay here again since it's in a great location. Plus, the guys at the bell desk will give you a ride (within 3 miles) in a Cadillac Escalade free of charge. That was a great when it came time to partying at night!"
1,"Eating in is a decent experience, but for delivery, I have yet to meet their match.  When I order delivery I always get a 16"" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top, and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times.  Its always tasty, fresh, and is my preeminent food for delivery, ever, period."
0,Probably one of the better gay bars in town.. friendly.. decent crowd.. reasonable prices.. after hopping from one to another this place was our favorite. Lots of furry muscle bears too! Nice!!
0,"This 2 stars is extremely generous. Wanna know why? Read on.

My party of 7 and a baby got to Pappadeux's around 6:30. We were told that it would be a 30-minute wait. It ended up being more than an hour. We were standing right in front of the hostess station, yet no one ever came to give us updates on how long it would be for our table. We would go check about every 20 or so minutes. One time we were told that our table was ready. When we went to check on it after about 20 minutes we were told that they were waiting on a busboy to clean it. A few minutes later they were still waiting on a busboy. In what universe does it take a restaurant 30 minutes to find a busboy to clean a table? We watched group after group after group get seated. A group of 7 that came after us was seated before us. We ended up being sat next to them; by the time we were getting our menus, they were finishing up their meals.

Once we were finally seated, we waited almost 10 minutes before someone came to our table to introduce himself as our waiter. When he asked how we were doing, we kindly told him that we were a little frustrated because it had taken more than twice as long as we were told, and we had been told twice that they were waiting on a busboy to clean the table. The waiter said that it was a busy night and said that he didn't get paid to deal with unhappy customers. He asked, ""So are you gonna do this or what?"" WHAT?! It was so rude - I don't know how he meant it, but it came across as sounding extremely annoyed. We were appalled and my boyfriend asked to speak to a manager.

The manager came over and spoke with my boyfriend. Not sure what was said, but after that things got much better. The manager brought us an appetizer plate on the house. Our food ended up being really good - including the alligator. I got shrimp etoufee, and it was great. The gumbo wasn't so fabulous. Overall, everyone was satisfied with their meal. We got three different drinks, and they basically tasted the same: like cherry Nyquil.

The food was good, but it's not always about the food. The service was horrible. Don't think I'd ever go there again. There are too many other places with great food and equally great service."
0,"We went here on a Saturday afternoon and this place was incredibly empty.  They had brunch specials going on, including $2 bloody mary's and mimosas, but we were more in the mood for lunch.  Except for the bloody mary, I had to try one.  It came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  Boo!  But it was really tasty. Yay!  The hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had Arrogant Bastard, and he got a 22 oz bottle for $4.75.  Hey, that's not fair!!

Next up: the wings.  We were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are ""seasoned"" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  We did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  These non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  The seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  If I were in the mood for the tang and kick of Frank's Hot Sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.

My entree was the Tilapia salad, and I was a bit disappointed.  The fish was a bit dry and uninspired. And the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  I ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and Mandarin oranges, but I had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.

It wasn't bad enough to say I wouldn't go back, but I won't be anxiously awaiting my next trip."
0,"My wife and I had lunch here. Not too hungry, so we shared 2 Spring Rolls ($3.75) and one dish, My Nam (4F, $7.50), Good thing we weren't hungry, as the dish size was smaller than we expected, but did have 7 shrimps. Spring Rolls were essentially tasteless, as was its peanut sauce. Dish was OK, and the broth (not meant to be a full soup) was excellent. 3rd star earned by an exceptional level of cleanliness. All in all, if you want Vietnamese, there are many others, but this is very convenient. Many more better choices"
1,"service was quite friendly and attentive, and the food was great.

the fig/goat cheese/mint bruschetta doused lightly with fig sambuca was delicious, though its relative heaviness and sweetness reminded me more of dessert rather than appetizer. 

roasted vegetable salad could be a meal by itself....very satisfying because it is not by any means a small serving and includes rich goat cheese and is served with wood fired bread on the side.

nothing better than wood-fired pizza (and bread)! the pizza with artichoke, red peppers, and mushrooms was phenomenal. the rappini pizza i sampled was good, but missing something....more garlic and onion perhaps?

the bread here was heavenly (as good or better than bianco), as was the pizza dough on both pizzas i tried. crispy on the outside without being fossilized or burnt, and chewy on the inside. lamp definitely has a handle on the bread/dough aspect.

i didn't try dessert, but the ones listed on the menu read highly tasty and unique in print...."
1,"Good clean Chili's. Friendly staff, although that can be a bad thing... since I have to tip them extra because they refill my cup every 5 minutes. I have been going a little bit more than usual because of the ""2 for $20"" deal. Never had a bad experience here, just wish there was more on the 2-20 deal."
1,"EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE! 

Even with Happy Hour in full swing and the place full of parched Winkies, the service at our large table was spot on. We barely had time to settle our bums and push the silver out to claim our table territory before iced H20 was before us, our drink orders were taken . . . and one quick blink of the eye and the ""peacemakers"" were before us!  

Now that's what I call HAPPY HOUR!

Bravo Thirsty Lion!"
0,"For what it is, cheap easy family friendly food with a bit of a yuppie bend, its not bad.

But they messed up a grilled cheese sandwich.
How do you do that? My mom, god bless her, can't cook to save her life. None the less, she can still make a pretty damn good grilled cheese.

Its not rocket science. Let me walk Sauce through this:
- Cut slices of cheese. Precut is pretty gross.
- Put bread around cheese.
- Apply butter to the outside.
- Grill til melted.

Yet, my girlfriend's grilled cheese was horrible. Bad bread, thin on the cheese, and it tasted like heated cat turds.

I'm just not that impressed. I know lots of you love this place, but I don't for the life of me know why.

It would have been 1 star, but the mac n' cheese bought it an extra star. 

Why is it so hard to find good pizza in Phoenix. You'd think with its mob proximity to Las Vegas that it'd have better Italian food. And yet, not so much. I blame the Mormon influence on this town. Too many years of Kraft products and special underwear have really killed the food talent here."
0,"Tried Rock Bottom tonight before a movie and I thought it was ok.
I had the Lemon Grilled Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus.  Everything was very yumm, but Rock Bottom just didn't make enough of an impression on me. If I was obsessed with beer maybe it would have gone over better. Restaurant ambiance and menu were very typical and neither were impressive. However my crazy friend Megan ordered Buffalo Fajitas, yes real buffalo steak, so that was a cool menu option. 
Now I can add Buffalo to the list of crazy things Ann Marie has eaten.

p.s Buffalo tastes a lot like steak."

1,"M-Troniks repaired a 1970's Fender Bassman 10 for me.  They re-coned the speaker, letting the stock speakers remain.  They also replaced the tubes and adjusted them.  New longer cord as well.  They fixed this old thing up!  

Crazy guitars for sale and other odds and ends."
1,"I've been to this theatre a fair share, but this time I went for the UFC 111 Georges St. Pierre vs. Dan Hardy.  Who knew one could watch UFC at the friggin movie theatre?!?!  They also show boxing fights.

At first, I was SO hesitant, I even walked back from DSW to ask if I could get my money back if I decided against going.  Yes, as long as it's before the fight.  It was $20, yeah kind of steep, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and I will go back when it's a big anticipated fight with a fighter I like.

But, come on, Georges fighting on a large screen!?!?!"
1,"OOOOOWWWEEEE!! Have yall tried ATL Wings yet!!! If not what are you waiting for!  They are the BOMB Diggity!

I don't know why I haven't updated my review either, so here I go! 


The honey habanero are still my #1 but I also love the Cajun Hot!  Holy Crap!! Get some of the Cajun Hot wings and some ranch and their hot sauce on the side, dip your wing in the ranch and then the hot sauce and watch out!! The only time you really feel the burn is when you're no longer eating, gums & tongue just be blaze hot and mouth just be water for more, yes my friends that's the heat I love!!


Luv me some wings from ATL!"
0,"In here for a sec but everyone seemed to be having a good time!  Live D.j. and enough room to be who u wanta be on the dance floor... there was poker going on in the corner and with a nice sized crowd. I liked the bartender chick, and she was fast for being the only bartender in there, and very nice."
1,"The Roaring Fork is one of my very favorite restaurants.  I am not a big fan of the environment, particularly the patio and back rooms, but the food more than makes up for it.  The pork green chili served with warm tortillas is dreamy.  I also adore the huckleberry margaritas.  Can't go wrong."
0,"Great food can be found anywhere. Great service is one in a million these days. This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did, don't even bother going. You'll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day.

It's simple. Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, etc., to garner new and potential repeat customers. Instead, after going there with my handy coupon, I can't help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received. 

I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole' prime rib. We sit down, am impressed with the old school decor, and then the server from Azkaban appears. We tell her that we'd like to order off the special evening menu where it's a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that it's our first time. Wrong thing to do. I don't know if it's because past Groupon-ers don't tip well or something, but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant. 

It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out. All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isn't to blame since I was never a liver fan). Not once did our server come by our table. We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables. It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasn't her fault and there's no use in calling her out for nothing. We asked if she knew where our server was, and she said she would look for her. 10 minutes later, nothing, yet it was the new server who kept coming back, asking if everything was alright like a normal server should. 

Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored. 17 minutes pass, no check came even though our  table had been cleared. Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check. He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didn't even want to see her face so another random server brought it back.

We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap. We didn't even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying. The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave, but whether they did or not I didn't even care at that point. 

To be honest, I can't even remember what the food tasted like, which isn't quite fair in a review. I went here a couple of months ago, but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food. I'm pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did.

Maybe it wasn't even the Groupon. Who knows. All I know is that we ran out of there like Usain Bolt and tell anyone who asks about our worst dining experience that this is the place to experience it."
1,"Stephen G. hit the nail on the head - ""You buy a peaceful experience"". I was looking for a resort/spa but also wanted to take advantage of horseback riding as much as I could. This resort definitely exceeded my expectations - the staff is AMAZING (friendly, accommodating, etc), the food was delicious, the resort is beautiful and the rooms were also clean and well-maintained. Everyone I encountered went the extra mile with regard to service. I came back to NYC completely rejuvenated."
1,"I've brought my dogs here and met with both Dr. Holmes and Dr. Edwards and they were both extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Over the last 15 years of living in Phoenix we brought all 6 dogs that we have had in that time to come see them and I wouldn't go anywhere else. This past summer I moved to Boston and regrettably haven't found a quality veterinary hospital like Pecan Grove. Ashamedly, even after talking to my current vet and be unsatisfied with their answers, we called Pecan Grove and Dr. Holmes was very helpful and was even able to reference cases and articles to us over the phone. While the answer we got from our Boston vet sounded more like they were guessing than actually knowing the answer.

Pecan Grove and everyone there is amazing and I wouldn't go anywhere else (had I not moved across the country)"
0,Everything was average.  Fairly clean place.  Banh Xeo had to much bean sprouts.  The proportion of veg to meat was off.
1,"Great service, I didn't get steak from here (yes, I know...a steakhouse), just got the Zesty Thai Salmon. The salmon was awesome with the chili mayo, baked potato, and asparagus. Can't wait to go back to try their other dishes.

Thank you Kathy (owner) for taking the time to send me the name of the dish! Had to update this review and rating because of it :D"
1,"I LOVE PITA JUNGLE! Why aren't they in Chicago?! Damn this unhealthy meat-lovin city! Let's try something different...

Anything I've had here was remarkable, and I've tried a couple of different Phoenix-based locations, so they're doing something right. Try the jalapeÃ±o hummus for a great spin to a Greek dish, and if you're really hungry, I highly recommend any of their lavosh pizzas. My favorite though? The Chipotle Chicken Lavosh Pizza, of course! It is delicious and mouth-watering.

I deduct 1 star solely for the fact that their parking lot is VERY inconvenient and way too crowded."
1,These guys are great!  They have helped me with bulbs needs for both my home and office.  Easy to work with and good prices.  Thanks!
1,"I have confirmed the rumors that Big Wong will be closing before the end of the year. The owners have been locked in to a lease they assumed for the last 15 years and with the down-turning economy aren't able to continue.

If you want a very reliable meal in a super friendly environment, rush on over before they close their doors forever.  : ("
1,Great service got there when they opened and hardly anyone was there. Our server mike was really nice. Tried the margarita chicken and  I loved it. Tequila lime sauce was to die for. And the quesadillia was huuuuuge! Its a little pricey but hello your in scottsdale!
1,"Another place that is really serene and makes you forget you are in a large city! I really liked the Desert Botanical Gardens and I am totally not into flowers or botany!  We had been to DBG once before for Luminarias, but it was so dark that we couldn't see much. I'm glad we returned in the daylight.

We took my inlaws yesterday after brunch and they absolutely loved DBG. My father-in-law is totally into photography, so DBG was awesome for him. We saw tons of people with cameras, so it is a photographer's haven.  I really had no clue there were so many types of cactus. There are hands on activities scattered throughout (probably for kids on field trips) and boards with information, which comes in handy on the Sonoran Desert Trail when you want to figure out which mountain in the distance is Camelback, Piestewa, Four Peaks, etc.  We saw little lizards, hummingbirds, quail, and ground squirrels while wondering around as well.

There is much to see and you can get through the gardens as quickly or as leisurely as you would like. We spent about two and a half hours there, which I think is a perfect amount of time. You see everything and are ready to leave by the end.  A very nice place to take visitors on a nice day."
1,"North Valley always has interesting articles to read and cool interviews with people like Alice Cooper and Young MC (Bust a Move!).

The magazine covers the entire north valley, which is very spread out. And you can find it in many different places, from Kierland to Anthem. It's free, but you can also get a subscription online."

0,I have been by this spot many times and I needed a place to eat lunch so I stopped in... I entered the restaurant and was seated right away. But then I sat there for a good 10 minutes and watched the workers walk around  then I got to see the owners little kid decide she was going to sit with the consumers in the booth a head of me... Then the kid started crying and it just does not need to happen I was kind of shocked please leave your kids at home if they are not working at the restaurant.  I ended up getting up and asking the staff if I could just get the lunch buffet. I got a bit of everything to try I enjoyed the rice and the chicken dishes... The fish dishes on the other hand not so good the fish puffs were cold and not good and the one fish dish super fishy tasteing. The bread was really good that came with the meal... So all in all I would say I will not be going back anytime soon nothing to write home about.

Our waitress was super helpful & gave terrific service! Thanks for making our 2nd visit to Half Moon one which makes us want to return again in the future!"
1,"This location opened up just 3 weeks ago, and offers high quality, natural products for mainly cats and dogs, although there is a very basic small animal section.  The emphasis is on foods that are more nutritious, healthier, and that don't have corn or soy in them. There is a large freezer section in the back with a good selection of raw food meals.  Also, there is a plethora of treats and toys for your furry friend as well.  The small animal foods section has a few small bags of hay, some treats, pellets, and toys.  I wasn't too impressed with their rabbit selection, and they did not offer high quality brands such as Oxbow which is a bit surprising since they have so many high quality dog and cat products.

Jill, the manager, was very enthusiastic and is very passionate about providing the best products for pets.  She showed me various treats, foods, and toys, and provided a lot of educational material on dog nutrition and health.  She provided a free sample of some nice grain-free dry dog kibble which is highly recommended on dogfoodadvisor.com, which I appreciated a lot since my dog is a bit picky with the food he eats.  This is definitely a place to go to spoil and pamper your dog or cat!"
1,"4.5 stars!

I've eaten at Liberty Market a few times already, but this morning marked my first breakfast- and what a fantastic meal it was!- of pancakes (3 in a stack; $6.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg#Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg w/ added topping of ""market-made granola"" ($1), a side of Grilled Flattened Meatballs ($3.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw#MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw, and a double-shot of espresso ($2) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg#M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg.  Service was in fine form-- I couldn't have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.  (FYI, I didn't really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!)

I've mentioned this once before, but I think it's such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!  Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.  After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, they're very greasy!), and caffeine, I'll be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!  (I'm hoping, anyway!)

p.s.  Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!  

Addendum:  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis!  Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market??

Helpful hint:  Free wifi can be accessed by entering the code printed at the bottom of your receipt."
1,"Delicious yet again! Pho, garlic green beans, papaya salad...they can do no dish wrong. The owner, Justina, is hip, cool, gorgeous and awesome! It's BYOB so bring a nice wine or beer...no corking fee so don't forget to tip well!

If you're eating and there's a big line of others waiting, please do what we do and go across the street to gelato so that other people don't have to wait an hour."
1,"Tried them out for Restaurant Week.  The food and service was excellent.  I will certainly be back and loved the atmosphere. We sat at a booth and very comfortably sat 3 adults.  The wait staff was non stop on refilling drinks, bringing more bread, making sure the food was cooked to order."
0,"eewh! yuck and wtf!?

This Barnes & Noble Book Store sucks for sitting back, relaxing and trying to read. I know it is not a library, and I don't expect it to be. But, come on - you can at least have some sense of trying to keep the noise level down and have some cozy seating. 

And... Yikes! The people here are gross. They had some couch-chairs to lounge in and they were - in all of their grossness. And they were reading magazines of all things. WTF buy it and go home and let your kids do kart wheels there. EEWH!

Then, those of us who actually purchased books and were trying to peacefully read them were in the cafe' - sitting on their dirty wooden benches - where I guess the servers there think that part of theirs jobs in serving coffee is to do a drum solo every time they empty the used coffee grinds into the trash can - which was about every 5 minutes. Yeesh! Luckily, I had my iPod. It was blasting and I still could hear them banging away. It was not a very cleanly area either. 

I was going to ask if they had wifi but I just high-tailed it out of there instead. This place is small too and their book selection is limited.

I have been looking for a place to go to read, work and drink some coffee in my area (Arrowhead) and this one is definitely crossed off of my list. 

Come here to try and find a book but don't come expecting to kick back and enjoy your novel or what have you. If you like people watching though, this may be your place. There are all kinds here.

PS: and I left my fav coffee mug at this crappy place - like I will go back and get it. I think I would burn it first - bummer!"
0,"what can I say about Glam... well, i really, really despise it. Every time I go there, I regret the decision. And in my grandiose style, I'm going to say why in a list:

1) Cash only!! But listen to this, the bartender will take your debit card, charge you a fee, and give you cash, which you can then use to buy drinks from the same bartender that just did the whole transaction. WHY???? 

2) The location kinda blows. It's in a weird strip mall across from another strip mall. Have you ever driven by there in the day time? It's shady then, imagine at night time.

3) too hipster. I feel like I am not allowed there as I work for the man, do not wear black leggings, or have razor cut bangs. I, in my mall clothing and ""mainstream"" style, stick out like a sore thumb.

4) The music is just a little off.... ii dunno how to say what I am thinking, it's just off.

Okay, the floor is fancy. That's about it.

(sorry, I'm a bar snob and Glam deserves my wrath)"
1,"I don't have much time to write this, but I do want to say a few things. 

I had four things so far here. My friend and I both enjoyed them immensely. I paid $16 + tip. 

I had the [A1 - Cha Gio - crispy egg rolls ] & [A2 - Goi Cuon Thit Tom - spring rolls] to start.

Oh man was this delicious. The first thing I loved when I walked in was the ambiance. Dim lit and let the sun do the lighting - very zen - if you're into that. I felt very comfortable here.

They had four sauces on the table. I have no idea what they are, but the one with red pepper flakes and oil -- the darker one -- oh wow. If you like heat added to whatever you're doing -- wow -- this stuff is for you! I loved it. 

Then I went with the Pho tai - sirloin soup. [P2* - Pho tai] - wow - broth was amazing. Everything was. 

For me, enjoying food means I need a few things. 

First - awesome food
Second - ambiance
Third - presentation

They had it all. I was very impressed by place to the plates. Don't change a thing. I hope  your business is very prosperous!"

1,"When shopping is an adventure and a destination, you must be heading to Tan Phat. This is a funky Asian market that has been there for me whenever I need water chestnuts (for wrapping in bacon, and they carry five different brands! Who knew so many companies were in the business of the water chestnut?) or kitchen supplies for Asian themed dinners. One of the first things that hits you upon entering in the smell of seafood. After acclimating to that, you'll find a huge selection of canned goods, dried seafood and mushrooms, a decent selection of fresh produce and an ample amount of ""novelty"" edibles (you know, those intriguingly package foodstuffs that you just can't find outside of Asian markets). 

The employees are usually polite. You may have to walk through every aisle to find what you need, but that's part of the adventure."
1,"An organized & clean store, a well educated & nice staff, a great selection of baby/kid products! I will never go to a babies r us again. Thank you Chandler buybuybaby!"
0,"I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business, and yet....

Last year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  ""You can't do that.""  ""What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling."" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  ""The owners don't allow it.""  ""They don't allow it?  It's a matching game.""  ""No.  You'll have to put it away.""

Now.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I should've just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).  

A couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didn't bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.    

I'd kind of like the ""Restaurant Impossible"" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I don't mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over."
1,"I've always had good service here, but we usually do the curbside pick up - my advice is to just order a few toppings.  The crust cannot handle more than one or two - and if you get the pesto, avoid getting pepperoni plus other meat, it's so greasy!  (Good, but greasy).  

Love the greek salad as well as their desserts."
1,"I was sad to come back to lai lai's and they no longer had the Mongolian :( boo,, but i took my mom there and we were starving so we decided to order off the menu. My mom is allergic to  msg and they helped us with what we should order. and she didn't get sick!! woo hoo.. we ordered three dishes and an appetizer to share between her , my bf, and myself, and we stilll brought food home, and I dont think we spent over $30 bucks for all that food!! it was very good to! i love good cheap food!! Ill be back, they are always friendly."
0,"Stayed for a few days. Was not impressed. I prefer Marriott, but was not available. The room was clean and check in was good. The pool and fitness center sucked. I had dinner in the restaurant, a hamburger. It was good. Over all downtown Phoenix sucks, nothing to do after 6PM."
1,"This private little Persian eatery serves up some fresh, albeit traditional, fare along with a healthy dose of friendly service. The hummus was good full of nutty, lemony goodness but was overshadowed by the garlicky goodness of the eggplant dip. I called it baba-ghanouj but the owners insisted on eggplant dip. I sat at the bar and the service was prompt and polite except that the conversation was steered political by the owner, a direct violation of bar stool rules and a slight affront to myself ,a former barman. Who isn't talking politics these days? Any way, they did gouge me on a couple rum and cokes for my friend at $8 a pop. The beers were OK. This was strictly an AA meeting- alcohol and appetizers.  Next, we tried the grape leaves, a straight-forward staple at places like this. We finished up with some tabbouleh and the special pickles which were really good dipped in the hummus.  I will say we went on a Friday and it was dead, Pita Jungle was way busier in the same shopping center so the price range might be a little high for students. However the meeting went as planned and I left happy.  Check it out then head over to the hookah bar across the parking lot."
1,"Unfortunately I don't get enough chances to come here but, I'd say I have been here about a dozen times and each time I have never been let down.  The beer is great, the food is great, especially their french fries and the crowd is OK.  Yes it is in Tempe and you're stuck with all the ASU kids but I like to come here in the summer time or when ASU is on break because it is the locals that are here.  It is not the nicest brewery that I have ever been to, but what they lack in aesthetics they make up for in beer.  A must go to place if you're in the Tempe area!"
0,"I will never know what the food tastes like because they were so so rude, I will not go back.  We came in and were given a table, menus were practically thrown at us.  And then we waited, and waited and waited.  We asked a woman working there, and she apparently did not speak English and indicated a man at the front would help us.  But he was too busy talking.  We got up and left.  No one even said a word when we left."

Went back last night for dinner, this place is still awesome. I had the Las Vegas Rolls, they were pure deep fried goodness."

0,"I read quite a few reviews on Yelp prior to checking this place out with a group of 10 or so.  We arrived and the table wasn't ready just yet - we ordered a variety of cocktails, menu driven cocktails, beer and wine. I had an 8th Street Ale - always a good choice.  I had to ask for a cold glass to put it in and when I was served the 2nd one, they didn't include it. I had to ask again.

The food:  Pretty good, actually. However, its totally overpriced and the portions are pretty small. So it makes the hurt on the wallet that much more severe.  Our waitress was cool, she put up with a lot of conversations in our group, sometimes being loud and not paying attention.

I would go back again, but most likely for lunch. Hopefully you would get the same size meal for a few bucks less.  By the way, I had the pasta with rib eye in it (I forget the name) and my wife had the Carbonara.  They were both good!"
1,"Tried Bombay Spice last night. After reading the website and reviews, it seemed like it would fit perfectly our combined need to finally find good Indian fare in Phoenix AND not blow our calorie budget (husband and I are trying--and succeeding!-- in losing weight). Success on both counts!

It was Saturday at about 6:30 and we were seated immediately. The place was almost full. We sat on the patio, which was lovely, but might get too hot during the summer (I didn't see any misters--You're Welcome, Mother Earth!). 

 Service was attentive, and our waitress gave us several recommendations. 

We ordered:
Somosas (baked, I think, not fried, which made them a little messier to eat but still very very tasty).
Naan (chewy, moist, naan-y...yum)
Grilled Shrimp skewers (a little on the skimpy side, but very tasty, and served with grilled peppers and onions and a delightful mint sauce).

We each ordered individual entrees with basmati. They encourage you to order the two-entree choice, but we were trying to avoid over-ordering, and it turned out to be exactly the right amount of food. 

I ordered the Cauliflower and potatoes, which was moist, savory, a little spicy, and very tasty, albeit lacking a little in the sauce department (I would have liked a little something to spoon over my rice).

Husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was exceptional. They claim that they don't use cream in their food, so I don't know how they made the masala sauce so creamy and good, but they did and I'm not going to question it any more! I would have licked the bowl if we had been at home. 

Next time I think we'll get some apps again but try the Bombay Plate to share, which is 5 entree choices and rice. That way we can try a whole bunch of things. 

$35 before tip for naan, two appetizers, and two single-choice entrees. Not bad for a Saturday out. We'll definitely be back, even though it was  kind of a drive for us."
0,"Their salad bar here is lacking. I used to go to Whole Foods when I was too lazy to make anything to eat, but didn't want to be riddled with guilt about eating out. 

The people who work here are friendly and they have a huge selection of canned veggies for salads, as well as other specialty items that may be harder to find out here.

They also carry the largest selection of Amy's Organic frozen foods that I adore. mmmmm tofu pockets..."
0,"This tiny sushi joint is in a prime location.  That's the real draw.
The sushi is just okay (and you can get the same sushi at Geisha-a-go-go which is more fun).  The hamachi kama is just okay.  The steak is just okay.  Overall, this place is average.

I wish I had better things to say about it, but the service was not great (it was not bad, just average) and the bill was high considering the quality of everything we ordered.

Would I come here again?  Nah."
0,"I stopped in here at 6:45am one morning and was told I was a bit early.  I'm used to coffee shops opening earlier I guess, but they were nice about it and invited me in to sit and wait. 

I liked their stacks of Latin American Vogue, and the artwork on the walls was nice.  They also had ice water out for you to serve yourself. 

I ordered my usual americano, and was pleased.  They have raw sugar you can serve yourself by the heaping spoonful out of a pretty candy dish.  That was lovely.

Also, they are now the only place to carry Sweet Peas Bakery items.  My favorite thing to do was walk down to Danielle's shop downtown and pick up some coffee at Royal and some of her Rosemary Shortbread cookies.  It doesn't sound yummy, but believe me they are!  Be sure to ask for some. 

At the time I went, the place was obviously not crowded and I received attentive service..."
1,"This is my boyfriends regular spot.  When I was approaching Bailey's for the first time, I was oh hell here goes a crumbly dive bar complete with raggedy cougars, mustaches and beer guts all along the bar.  To my surprise, it is a pretty cool neighborhood spot to get some drinks on the cheap, the margaritas by Clay are great, stiff but not too strong.  Friendly bar staff, wait staff could be quicker, more outgoing, they're ""aiight"" thoough, lol.  The crowd varies with the day and time, yes there are the beer belly's and the nascar hats being proudly worn, but some evenings they play top 40's and the crowd is younger, and a notch or two better looking.  At this come as you are bar, people seem to have a good time shooting pool and having some belly laughs with friends.  Again, drinks are way cheap and that helps a ton for a fridays night out or pre-drinking on a sat night to get the party started.  It feels like going to Mulligans in Scottsdale, but for a lesser dime and a mile less pretentious."
1,"My brother from San Francisco was in town and missing the sushi from the bay area. I decided I'd let him choose where we'd go out even though I'd never ever heard of this place before. It was definitely in a not-so-glamorous area, tucked on the side of a dinky shopping center (sorry shopping center). When we walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the quaint atmosphere and set-up. It's definitely small but everyone working there and eating there seemed to be genuinely having a great time. 

We sat at the bar/long table in front of the sushi chefs which was a fun experience. We started off with sake, and it was pretty darn smooth. We ordered a variety of different dishes including sea urchin eggs, yellowtail shashimi and the king crab roll. They were even accomodating to make my brother dishes that weren't on the menu. The chefs are so nice and fun and the prices are pretty good!

My brother was extremely impressed coming from a top sushi city. I look forward to coming back and trying more of their extensive menu, especially for happy hour."

1,"We just moved to town and were looking for a place exactly like this.  This bar is not posh, it is not shiny or pretty, it doesn't have a huge menu... and that is all fine by me.  

What it does have is a friendly wait staff, plenty of seating, good/ok live music, and a great bar selection.  

The mix of people that was there the night we stopped in was entertaining... I can't really comment on that, as I still think everyone here in Phoenix is crazy... lol.  

Either way, it seems to have that good old suburban bar feel to it, which is nice and cozy when you don't feel like dolling yourself up and having a fancy night out."
0,"Living in this area I frequent Desert Ridge a lot, and have been to this Macaroni Grill several times... their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times... My friend and I have had experiences such as standing at the host stand with no assistance for several minutes while several employees made eye contact. Of course, no one asked if we had been helped, until the hostess finally made her way back up to the stand and decided to ignore us for another couple of seconds before she even acknowledged us. 

Another visit we were seated right away however it took over 15 minutes for our server to come to our table, and that was only after I had to get out of my seat and find one of the employees to ask for our server. I know several people saw us just sitting there, the least they could have done was asked if we had been helped or not. 

This last experience, was about a year after the last. I thought maybe they would have changed. I most definitely thought wrong! We were seated promptly and the server was there right away this time. However, our food took FOREVER! Literally, it took over 30 minutes for a medium rare steak and a plate of pasta. I know for a fact they messed something up and ended up taking food out of a to go container and placing it on the plate that they then brought to me (you can see right into their kitchen from the dining room). The server never apologized nor did she come and tell us what the hold up was. 

Overall, I will never go to that restaurant again."
1,"Check this out...I JUST HAD A RUBEN FOR BREAKFAST!!!!! 
I saw the article about this place in the Tempe newspaper. We were already heading to the Healing Field at Tempe Town Lake9/11/10 and wanted to stop for breakfast. We had the dogs with us so choices were limited. My boyfriend went into Stan's and they let us sit on the patio with the pups. 
They serve their entire menu all day. I'm not a huge eggs and bacon kind of person so I love having something a little different in the morning. 
I ordered the Ruben and allowed Kelly the waitress (who was fabulous) to choose the side. 
The food took a little while to arrive. 
When it did...Holy Cow!!! 
My sandwich was huge and she brought all three sides so we could taste them all. That is great customer service! My favorite was the slaw, then potato salad. 
The food was fabulous and the staff was more than accommodating. The owner stopped by our table and chatted awhile. 

I will no doubt be back. Thank you so much Stan's for the wonderful start to my day!"
0,"I have been a long time customer at this car wash with this location. I have been going there since it Changed from Weiss Guys to Diamond Car wash and now its known as Francis and Sons. It seems the service has declined for each change of ownership.
 
Today was the tip of the iceberg and I will not be going there again. The past 2 visits have proven to me that their customer service has rapidly declined.
 
I understand that every business needs to ""Upsell"", but it becomes an annoyance when they keep bugging me 5,6,7,8 times after I have said no. Don't even get me started on their glass repair salesmen....

I always get the Premium auto wash, a few weeks ago I went and when I got home I noticed they had not cleaned my dash or center console (which is included in premium). I also noticed they had not wiped down my tires after applying Armor All and it all splattered up to the sides of my vehicle after driving away, I wrote these off as a simple mistake and that it probably would not happen again.
 
Today's experience was worse. I took my truck in for a wash and I told the guy I did not have time for a hand wax (upsell) I was then pressured into buying it in advance so I could come back another day and get it waxed. No was not an answer to this guy, I had to actually walk away to leave this Pressured UPSELL.
 
Again, I purchased the premium wash. They called for the vehicle and I noticed that there were little black spots (mud?) all over the side of the truck. I told the guy about this and he said ""its ready."" I explained that it wasnt and started using my finger to poke at what was probably 20-30 little black spots all over the side, he gave me a disgusted look and told me he had to go get a clean rag. I asked for a manager.
 
The manager came and had the guy wipe the spots off, but did not seem to care at all and walked away before the guy wiped down half of the spots. I had already given a tip to the first guy and this guy stood there expecting a tip, I am generous with tips, but will not tip more because I had to ask them to fix their mistake.
 
Upon entry of my vehicle I noticed there was still some dirt on the floor and my center console armrest was not cleaned. I only took the truck in due to my dog leaving paw prints on the center armrest and hair all over the place...
 
I got an oil change at Danny's Car Wash at Tempe Marketplace a few weeks ago, and was so Impressed by their service and car wash service that I will make the 20 minute trip to go up there for my car wash from now on."
1,"We ate here while waiting for our tire to be fixed across the street.  This place used to be The Vine for many years, until it closed and the building became two different restaurants. 
The service was very friendly, and the menu had many different items in case you don't like sushi.  We tried 2 different Bento Boxes of ribeye teriyaki (the online menu lists it as new york strip) and chicken teriyaki.  Bento boxes come with so much food!  You start with a pretty good Miso soup, and then the box comes with salad with a yummy soy vinagrette, two pork potstickers, rice, and fruit - in this case, orange and apple slices.  The steak was tastefully seasoned and melted in my mouth.  The chicken was tasty as well, but I liked the beef better.
Then we opted for a few pieces of sushi, since this is a sushi bar.  We had the Nigiri salmon and cooked shrimp, a california roll, and a house specialty called the Tukee Roll.  It is basically the california roll that is rolled in crunch tempura bits, and drizzled with unagi sauce and miso orange sauce.  This was one of the best rolls ever!  A great twist on the plain california roll.
Our iced teas were a bit pricey at $4.50 for 2.  Too bad we were too full for dessert.  Check out their website for an unusually tasty menu.  www.tankedfishaz.com."
0,"2.5 stars-
went to Lolo's for lunch on a Sunday- the place was nice and busy- waited maybe 3 minutes for a table.  Were seated but had to wait an additional 20 minutes for a high chair as the 2 they had onsite were being used.  Ordered the Te-Te's (2 chicken legs and 1 waffle) along with French Fries and Beans Over Rice.  Food came out with my entree about 4 minutes before my friend's did.  We were never brought out the fries or beans and rice- reason for it per the server- there was a big party (8ppl) slowing the kitchen up.

Food was good, not great, staff was very nice and hospitable. I will go back to give this place another shot- try something different on the menu as the waffles were super heavy and doughy.  Chicken was cooked to perfection- I swear I could have eaten 10 pieces!!"
1,"As you may have read in a previous review, so graciously provided by Dally, that Four Peaks is our post-Tuesday night hockey watering hole. We normally show up stinky and limping or in some sour mood or another. Somehow we always leave a little happier, but still limping, well I do anyway. 

Unfailingly, we are greeted by the bouncer, who no longer cares to see our ID's, either because he can see the age in our strides or because he knows us now. I would like to believe the latter. Also, waiting for us is the lovely and nicht so talented Karina. Bless her poor soul for putting up with our asinine questions about her life and our requests for more water. She humors us anyway. 

We are made to feel like this place is home, at least for a couple of hours on a Tuesday night. Karina knows what we order for drinks and never has to ask, just brings. I usually switch between a simple salad with a great balsamic vinaigrette or a plate of fries. I know, diametrically opposed. Just depends on the mood and how committed I am that day/week to my diet. I always get the 8th St Ale though. It is very good and for 3 bucks can't be beat. 

I have enjoyed the pretzels, the now ""famous"" nachos, with chicken mind you, the spinach-artichoke dip, some of the various wing flavors, and a pizza. For late night dining they are all very palatable.  I have a funny wing story, but I think it is only funny to me, Dallas, Z, and our friend Peter.  If we ever get the elusive Z to join, I will make sure he shares his story on here.

Until then, check out Four Peaks in Scottsdale.  The late night menu satisfies and is not hard on the wallet.  Tell Karina Brad sent you.  You won't get a discount, maybe just a laugh."
1,"This place has a great selection of Korean dishes and even some Japanese.  This is a family favorite, from the stews, the BBQ, the bibimbop, to the side dishes.  The staff is always friendly, sometimes a little slow, but always a great experience.  There is a sushi bar and you can either cook the BBQ at the table (2 people or more) or have it cooked for you in the kitchen."
1,"I wrote a review of this place back in mid-September and gave it only 3 stars... what the fuck was I thinking? 

The food here is fucking brilliant... especially for a chain. Amazing burgers. Their Diablo Chicken pasta dish is to die for. The cornbread is actually good - I fucking hate cornbread and yet I'll scarf this shit down like it's crack. Their chips and salsas aren't that great - they'll do the job, but I'm still not convinced about them. I'm also unimpressed with the sides that come with the mains, but I don't come to this place to eat the sides. 

As I've said before, their margaritas are awesome. They'll fuck you up though, so make sure you have a ride home or else go see a movie to sober up. 

The atmosphere is low-end upscale and pretty nice and cozy - kinda dark inside and a bit generic, but generic is better than flashy, ugly and distracting. Service is upscale as well and I'm usually pretty pleased with it. They offer free valet parking for customers too which is perfect now that they charge an arm and a leg for the parking structure.

Here's my old review for reference: 

Great margaritas to be had here... really strong and tasty. This location isn't very busy ever it seems... perhaps with Fat Tuesdays around the corner, it's just too much competition.

It's a good place to grab a strong margarita before heading over to the movies or something. Their food doesn't inspire me to eat there, so all I've had are appetizers so far... mainly chips and salsa.  Salsa sucks.

It's also got some competition from Macayos down the street which doesn't help. I don't know if this place can stay in business much longer unless it gets busier. It could just be the times I was there though."
1,"I'm a big fan of Silver Mine. I have been for a long time. In fact, I would venture to say that this is my favorite sub place. Ever. I can't quite pinpoint what is so appealing about it to me. I do know that it was a dangerous decision to decide to live within a mile of this shop. The employees are super friendly, the restaurant itself is clean, the food is cheap and oh-so-good. 

Personally, I recommend the Pikes Peak or Bust which is a veggie cheese sandwich. I love it and have turned into the type of person that gets the same thing every single time...yikes! 

P.S...They also deliver until the wee hours of the morning and it doesn't get much better than a tasty sub when you have been out and about in Scottsdale on a Saturday night :)"
0,"One hour. That is how long we waited after ordering before we decided we would rather eat anywhere that wasn't here. A crushing, impressively underwhelming experience in lack of service.

We arrived, found we had free valet parking? With a teensy parking lot, this works, thank you. A good selection of indoor and outdoor seating? Also a plus. Setting expectations and/or taking care of waiting customers? FAIL.

On a beautiful AZ autumn morning we came here (tho we entered Rockerij). We asked to be re-seated outside because inside of Rockerij is dark as a tomb and had loud, conversation intruding, music. We were reseated by the fireplace, and a waiter came over shortly to take our order. Bam. So far so good...or so we thought. 30 Mins after placing our order, I ask another waiter to check on the status of our food and he cleverly asks about what we ordered (exactly)...so we think it is being taken care of. 40 MINS after placing our order, I have still only had my coffee refilled once...and had to flag down another waiter to inquire about the status of our food again, because our actual waiter is nowhere to be found and the previous ""drive-by"" waiter never returned. A few mins beyond that, this guy actually comes back and indicates that our order is nearly ready and should only be a few minutes longer. Shortly thereafter OUR waiter stops by with comments of: 

""I don't know why it's taking so long...""
and
""I put the ticket in right after I took your order...""

So...as a waiter...maybe it might be part of your job to check on the status of an order say...15mins after bringing it by the kitchen? Perchance? What do you think?

FIFTEEN (15 == few?) minutes later, we still had no food and I'd had quite enough. Out the door we went.

On a comical note: As we were outside (another 5 minute wait because the valet had our car either parked in Egypt somewhere or tandem?) our waiter came out to find us to let us know that our food was ready if we'd like to come back inside?

Oh R E A L L Y? The Clue-Delivery Train will be visiting you shortly. Facial cues you may want to look for in the future are:

3) curling fists

It seems that we are not alone in this. Courtney W.'s review (10/14/12) is representative of what we experienced.

I am dumbfounded how they have any good reviews. There must be a serious drought of sit down restaurants in this part of town, because this crap would never fly where I live. I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.

P.S. They own 3 restaurants apparently: Richardson's, Rokerij, and Dick's Hideaway...all right in the same area (Rokerij and Richardson's being attached). 

P.P.S. They all serve the same menu. It is NOT amazing. I have previously been to Dick's. Yes, it is good. No my socks did not come flying off.

P.P.P.S. ProTip: Drive down to Central Phoenix and go to Durant's, Portland's, Switch, or Fez. All of these places have exemplary service and food to match."
1,Love this place.  Buffalo chicken breast on a pretzel bun was amazing. Love the atmosphere too!
1,good place to kill an evening. I used to spend my time here many moons ago. good coffee at good prices.
0,I thought this bagel shop was ok. The bagel sandwich I got was relatively lackluster. I think I will stick to Einsteins for the time being.
1,"...the customer service alone gets 5 stars, but when you factor in the semi-annual sales it is more like 6.  Having been to a number of Nordstrom's in multiple cities I'd put this particular location on the same level as those in San Francisco (without the assinine traffic to contend with) and Seattle and only a notch below the best of the best in Chicago.  

Living in a city with a Nordstrom and a Nordstrom Rack is going to be a daily exercise in resisting temptation."
0,"If it wasn't for the bad food I would go here more than once or twice a year.  The meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second. Now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie, I order a salad only. Because they do catering, I have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers.  

The service is OK. They have a couple of generic draft beers. Everything is overpriced.  Caveat Emptor if you order an entree."
0,"I wish they had a ""0"" star option too!

The service and food was awful. Just a bunch of kids running the place.  The place closes at 10pm but when we went in there at 8pm all the workers were too busy cleaning to go home early to help us.  The food was burnt  on one side and raw on the other. The manager was too busy flirting with the other help. We couldn't get drinks because all the glasses where dirty, we were told by our waitress. We asked for the manager before we left at 8:45 and was told he already went home for the evening. What kind of manager leaves a bunch of teenager to run the place? 

NEVER GOING BACK!!!!"
0,"I have to admit, I love a good Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches...So when I heard about this place I had  try it.  We made the drive down there...park in the parking garage off of 5th st.  Walked to the resturant and was pretty impressed.  Place was really clean, guys behind the counter were as nice as philly people can be.  Then I looked at the menu, saw what I wanted to order and ordered it.  I ordered an full size cheesesteak with cheese wiz...i made it a combo.  I was shocked that it came out to like $13 for a sandwich, drink and fries.  When I finally got my food, I was impressed with the taste but don't know if it's worth the $13 I paid for it.  If you don't want the combo, the full sandwich is still $9.  So if you want a good sandwich, be prepared to friggin pay for it."
1,"A burger? With anything I want? FINE....I'll do it.

I need no convincing for a burger, fries and a coke (Thanks Carl's Jr.) 

Earleir this afternoon, after a heavy morning of househunting with a couple realtors, I decided to sit my fat backside at a table and eat. And eat well.

I stumbled into the Five Guys at the Fashion Square mall. Not sure how long it's been open. Perhaps it was the grand opening?

It was PACKED! But I digress.

As soon as you get to this location in the food court of the mall, you'll realize that this is not your typical burger joint. They have their own seating separate from the mall-commoners. And their own bathrooms (CLEAN)

You get to the counter and you see a sign telling you about the potatoes they are using for the fries you will be eating.

Ordering your burger isnt a gong show. Fairly easy. All the toppings are listed and all toppings are FREE!

My food was delicious. Got a burger with some of my favorite toppings: onions, tomatoes, etc. 

The fries reminded me of an experience I had back in high school, when I held a girls hand for the first time. Soft, perfect and lovely. That's how these fries felt. Ok that sounded weird. Tough.

Oh, I forgot to mention that the soda fountains had COKE ZERO!! EFFING AWESOME! I MEAN THIS IS THE MOST DOPE SODA EVER!! 

(I'm really hoping this Kanye yelping phase ends soon, since my reviews make me seem like a bigger Jackass than I seem in person).

Ultimately, I left this place happy, satisfied and I will come back again.

Oh...the answer to the one question in everyone's mind? YES, BETTER THAN IN-N-OUT!"
0,"My wife and I were downtown with some friends, and decided to check this place out. I ordered a pasta lunch, and chose Penne Alla Campagna and another penne with tomatoes and Mozzarella. Meh, it was just okay. The food was just okay, kind of bland and a bit overpriced. I did snag a small slice of pepperoni pizza from one of the kids at our table that was actually the best part of my meal. Would I go back, nope no sir"
1,"I've been planning a visit to the Public Market for some time now, and was downtown today so I finally stopped in for lunch.  I had the ""Friggin Chicken"", which was friggin delicious.  The market fare is counter service, but when I was ordering the cashier was very friendly and courteous and brought my food to me out on the patio.

This was a very pleasant first experience, sitting on the patio reading a book, sipping my canned mint green tea, and eating my sandwich with a side of couscous.  The atmosphere was very relaxed and there were others nearby sharing a bottle of wine, or just finishing up their lunch with good conversation.  Speaking of the wine, there was an impressive wine and craft beer selection.  I'll be going back to sample the beverages very soon.

On my way out, I stopped at the coffee bar for a latte, which was much more bold and flavorful than your ""Fast Food Coffee"" variety; a great way to finish off my lunch.  If you're looking for a quick, inexpensive, fresh and local dining experience, check this place out."
1,"I really like this place. However it does suck time like no other place.

Somehow evertime you are there for over 2 hrs?

I usually try on 60 items to get 1 that fits well, and cry a half dozen times about being fat :(

Then I cruise the little kids clothes because the mens clothes are to large for me and the womens are cut weird.

One of my boobs is like a 3rd the size of the other so its soo hard to find clothes that dont make me look like a cancer survivor.

Anyway, good finds here. Try the clothes on even if it says the size is smaller than you wear. A lot of times it says one size but is really another.
My girlfriend bought 200.00 jeans for 20.00 a piece because it said they were a 24 when they were really a 27.


P.S. anyone know where to find some dress vests?

The womens ones are too short and make me look like I have flowing love handles and the mens vests are to big in the shoulders and ribs.

I think I should try maybe a kids vest? thoughts?"
1,"No rake, no annual membership or fees.  Just a fun ""home"" game in a strip mall minutes from my parents' house.  They have 1-2 and 2-3 NL games and the min buy is $40, max is $500. Everyone is friendly and they offered us snacks and drinks while we played.  Since there isn't a rake or fee, don't be cheap (like one guy there) and tip the dealer generously."

0,"A little disappointed...  We have been waiting for the right moment to visit this place and today turned out to be that day.  First of all, the location is in the middle of what looks to be a ghost town.  The interior had a lot of character with items like the family owned John Deer tractor ;)  Anyway, we had the full slab with 2 sides, a bottle of ginger beer and a drink.  Honestly, I expected more from this place.  The meat was dry, bland and over done.  My bf and I both agreed that our fav in Arizona is still Famous Dave's where pay pretty much the same price, get to sit and relax while they serve you, and the food is better.  

*Location = kinda out there
*Price = for a cafeteria style bbq....I think it's a little much
*Food = it's not all that...at least to us
*Decor = very classic and full of character

*** I just received a really nice message from the owner, Joe.  I think it's wonderful that Joe cares about each customer's comments and reviews.  Even though my review was not a very positive one, Joe was polite and very kind.  Thank you Joe and I think I'm definitely gonna persuade my bf to try your restaurant again :)***"
1,"I loved the crispy crust of the pizza thought it was super good.  I think if you haven't been there and are at the San Tan Mall shopping that its worth a visit.  We went on a double date and it was a pretty good experience.  The only issue I had was that I thought they had a very small dining area, which was probably the reason for the 45min wait.  Also we went on a friday night and probably because of the small area it got very loud, which I know the management has no control over, but just an fyi of my experience.  I'd say if you haven't been and you love pizza its worth the visit.   I may try and stop in for lunch sometime but definitely not on a Friday night, it was just too busy."
1,"Thai food is one of my favorite types of cuisines. I have been going to Thai Rama for over 5 years now, and they are always consistent! this place is a little, hole in the wall type. (those are usually the best)
Whenever I am having a thai fix I usually order the same items. Sometimes different... But not always. 
OK..
1. Thai tea... the best in the valley! 
2. Pad thai with chicken... level 5 - 5 is usually med spice but to some ppl its very spicy... you can always lower the number to a 1 or 2 and it'll still be just as good.
3. Yellow pork or chicken coconut curry with potatoes, onions, carrots, & pineapple.... level 5 again.... my fave
4. There's one more beef dish that is absolutely delish! But, I forgot the name. Basically all it is, is thick rice noodles and thinly sliced beef stir fried.. Kind of like a chow fun but better!

Oh and I would also like to add that they have a very friendly waitstaff and pretty good service.

If you like Thai, check this place out!!!"
0,Average sushi but lots of fun.  I love just taking things off the conveyer belt.  Alcohol is also a bit pricey.
0,"3/5

the sandwiches are huge. i'm not to bent on the whole freedom fries this and such on the menu, but it is AZ so i guess that is how it runs."
1,Great mall. has pretty much everything.
1,"We get a date night rarely throughout the year, so I try and find something new when ever we get that chance. Once we made it into the restaurant we were both quite pleased with the decor and the atmosphere, little did we realize that this was just the beginning! The wait staff here is beyond friendly and knowledgeable, our server Sam was what you would consider first class in every aspect. His attention and knowledge started our evening off in such a way that I feel indebted to him!! Then comes the food....! We had a four course meal that not only included a wine pairing for two of the courses, but also a pre-dinner cocktail. The food was exquisite, the pork chop with the kale and pickled onion main course was grand, and the paired wine could not have been better."
0,"I don't know why I waited so long to try this place when it is literally right around the corner from my house.  I think its because I went to the one in Ahwatukee a long time ago and didn't care for the food.  But I don't think they have the same owners since the websites are totally different.  But anyway, on to the review.

We ordered takeout and I was very impressed with how nicely it was all packaged and how quickly it was ready.  Also, the woman on the phone was very friendly, easy to understand in spite of an accent, and patient in explaining the menu items that I was unfamiliar with. All the appetizers sounded so good, we decided to get a bunch so the hubby and I could just pick at them since he was sick and didn't have much of an appetite.  However, the portions were bigger than expected so we ended up with quite a lot of food.  Lettuce wraps were very tasty, I loved the dressing on them.  Eggrolls were good but a little too much ""wrapper"" and not enough filling IMO.  Sweet potato chips were not what I was expecting, they were the white sweet potatoes that really don't have much taste to them and they were deep fried with I believe a panko breading on them.  A little bland but the sweet/hot dipping sauce they came with was fantastic.  I loved it so much I would order this again just for the sauce.  Also got some chicken soup for the sick hubby which I didn't try but he said was quite good. I threw in some pad thai noodles since that basic dish is always my test when evaluating a new Thai restaurant.  I asked for a four (out of five) on the spiciness scale and that was perfect for me.  I was very pleased at the heat level and overall flavor of the dish.  So many places hold back on the chiles if you are American, even if I insist I want it hot, and I have never understood why. The only thing missing was a squeeze of lime and garnish of fresh cilantro that I like on my pad thai.  Presumably you could get that upon request if you were dining in, it was no big deal to me since I had some at home.

I still prefer Yupha's as the best Thai in the area.  But I will definitely be back here for takeout because of the friendly, speedy service and convenient location.  I noticed some wine bottles in the back when I was picking up my food so that may entice me to dine-in at some point as well."
0,This place is nowhere near where yelp says it is. It is at Chandler and Ray road not in the industrial area.
1,We were trying to choose a new place for lunch at work and this was mentioned. We all LOVED it! (that is saying a lot!) We ordered off the online menu and I called it in (she was VERY friendly) it was ready in less than 10min and was hot and delicious!!! It also doesn't cost an arm and a leg and is close enough to go there fairly often. We will be back!
1,"I always look forward to a haircut with my fave Barber, David. $13 always gets me the cut I want. I used to head down to a another Barber off of Central Ave but never got the haircut I wanted. Now I never have to worry about that. So if you're ever in need of a Barber shop cut, give David or one of his gals a try. Cheers!"
0,"The food was excellent ... the service not so much. 

A colleague and I took one of my clients here for a business dinner. The atmosphere was great, the food was outstanding but the service was embarrassing. 

It was a fun, Arizona type feeling restaurant and made quite the difference for my clients who are originally from Scotland. 

I had the roasted shrimp and grits. The grits were the best I have ever had (sorry North Carolina!). The shrimp portion was amazing. The dessert was great. I was surprised to see the offering of huckleberries. 

Sadly, the server forgot quite a bit of things. My client's wife ordered a second glass of wine to have for dinner, which was forgotten. We also asked for corn bread - the server forgot and brought it with our dessert. He tried to explain that it is made fresh to order and that is why it took so long."
1,"While I am giving this restaurant four stars, I must start off by noting that the pizza here is mediocre.  If you want spectacular pizza in Phoenix, don't kid yourself that it's at I-17 and Thomas.  It's over at Pizzeria Bianco.

However, the other items on the dinner menu are worthy of a visit to the 'hood.   The Penne alla Vodka ($12.95) offers up pasta in tomato sauce with bacon, fresh basil cream and vodka.  It is an excellent starter to split with a dining companion and that's exactly what the BF and I do every time we visit this place.  The Cozze Posolipo mussels in garlic white wine sauce ($11.95) are also quite tasty as an appetizer.  The complimentary warm pizza dough they serve with an onion and olive topping is a nice touch.  For entrees, the Pollo Parmigiana ($14.95) is the classic breaded chicken breast with marinara, mozzarella and parmesan cheese served with penne.  The Lasagna della Casa with Bolognese sauce ($13.95) is very good, but the portion is a bit stingy for the price.  The BF often enjoys the Gamberi alla Pana ($15.95) that includes jumbo shrimp sautÃ©ed with mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce over a bed of fettuccine.  Please note that the brandy cream sauce is extremely rich.  Another tasty option is the Spaghetti con Salsiccia ($13.95) with mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and Italian sausage in marinara sauce with a touch of white wine.  The Cheese Ravioli ($13.95) is another great choice with the tomato cream sauce.  For dessert, be sure to order a Cannoli Siciliani ($5.95) as it's the very best I have had in Phoenix.  The Tiramisu ($5.95) is good as well.

The bad news is that this place is no longer BYOB.  For whatever reason, the management decided that a restaurant that seats no more than 20 needed a full liquor license.  I really hope that the investment in that spendy license doesn't lead to the undoing of this place.  Given that they don't even have a bar area and I almost never see anyone order a mixed drink, I think staying BYOB might have been a better choice for this neighborhood joint.

The service at this place is also part of the show.  The waiter may well be manic as he will either be way up or way down for your visit.  The dÃ©cor here is pleasant enough given the location of this tiny restaurant in a modest strip mall.  If you happen to need a trip to the restroom, you will get the chance to traipse through the kitchen.

All in all, Pizza A Metro is ironically a great option for everything but pizza."

1,"This place is so unique! I was disappointed that it was closed the weekend of my birthday in July, but I won't hold that against them!

This bar/boxing ring/vintage store/food truck/soda fountain is super awesome! My cousin took me here a few years ago and since then it's been a place that I always show friends and family members when they want to go out downtown. The drink list is pretty extensive, with lots of organic cocktails served in cute mason jars. You definitely get a good sized drink! The beers are cheap, the food is so-so. I think it's a bit overpriced, so I'd recommend eating somewhere else beforehand. 

The boxing ring is random, but I've seen friends go up there and fight in a drunken stupor, and that is a sight I'll never regret seeing. Some nights they have karaoke, which I've chosen to partake in a few times. I've seen DJ's there on the weekends, and I really like how they switch up the music genre each time. Sometimes it's rap, others rockabilly and oldies. On Tuesday nights they do FREE swing dancing lessons and I've been really wanting to try that!

i love the vintage feel to the place and am surprised it's not packed all the time!"
